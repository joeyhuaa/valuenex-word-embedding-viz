contacted polaroid support and they told us it was a 'limitation of the z-ink paper technology' and that's the best they were gonna look. We even had Amazon replace the unit and the quality was still pretty bad. We ended up trying an HP sprocket instead and the pictures came out a lot better, so I would definitely recommend it over this unit. Plus, their mobile app is better and doesn't require you signing up for an account, like the polaroid one does.", "The Quality of photo was not very good, i had returned it a month ago but still didnt get any refund", "I bought this to print off pictures to at my wedding for my guest book.

So if any of you are thinking of picking up this cute little photo printer for Christmas skip the one by Polaroid.  It\u2019s not worth the hassle of tinkering, closing and reopening the app a half dozen times and never knowing if it will print your photo or nah. Hp makes one and I may try that one as it gets much higher reviews.\n\nUpdate:  I bought some more paper and thought I'd try it again.  I have to select to print a photo about 6-8 times before it prints once.  In the meantime it goes through all the steps (about a minute long from the app) and nothing comes out.  I have an iPhone 8plus and the most recent version of the software.  I'm so disappointed because I'm doing a family journal with photos and it's quicker and easier for me to print the photos at Walmart and crop them myself.", "It messed up several instax i bough to use for the first time", "Aweful product, total waste of money.

The first few photos were adorable and great quality...  but then it went downhill.  She hadn't even finish a 10 pack photo paper and the image quality was terrible, extremely poor and was not even worth trying to print and waste more photo paper.

My family doesn't have too much money so they saved up for it, which I was grateful for.\n\nUnfortunately they unknowingly bought me a fancy paperweight. You need a specific app to print (I have an iPhone) and that's where the issue comes in. The app is notoriously bad - check the reviews for yourself. It's riddled with bugs and the developers clearly don't care. The current update renders the printer completely unusable, because the app crashes each and every time it loads. Seriously, read the reviews.", "when I received mine, it had the instructions and the camera that's it. and when I tried to use it, I noticed there was an empty place where the battery should be! it was supposedly, included, but no. and neither was the charger cord either. this was a gift and it turned out to not work out whatsoever. DONT BUY FROM THIS SELLER.", "If I could I would give it a negative number. I love the idea of having a sticky backing to the pictures. The charger well the lack there of...it comes with the wire but not the outlet part of it that you plug on the wall. The app sucks! I started to play around with it, I wanted to be able to use for my son\u2019s birthday party. I went ahead and charged for a few hours, I took a picture as I\u2019m editing this picture within the app (adding text and stickers) which took me about 3 minutes or so..the printer shut off on me, which means that I had to turn on the power back on the printer and then reconnect to Bluetooth what made it even more annoying is that I couldn\u2019t reconnect the printer via Bluetooth within the app! If you can\u2019t do that, then why is there an option on the app?????!!! So I would have to go ahead to my settings and do it that way. This happened to me on every picture! So what\u2019s the point of having the ability to edit a picture if the printer is going to shut off after a certain amount of time, which in my case it was less than 3 minutes?\n\nThe day of the party came. I charged it and figured I would stick it out! The damn printer is dead! So I plugged it in, which in the meantime I took pictures with my phone. When it came time to print the printer would NOT connect to my phone!!!! The next day I got an alert that I needed to update software, which is did and it started to work after I did an update deleted the app only to reinstall it! Even after all that crap the damn thing couldn\u2019t hold a charge. Upset and annoyed it went back! What a waste of time and stress, and more importantly it ruined my party because I spent more time messing with this piece of crap than being the host.", "Buy Polaroid Camera", "The photo quority wasn't good but I was satisfied the product because I had just used it for the recording my life.\nHowever,,,\nI wanted to use it for the first time in over six months. I tried to connect it to iPhone and iPad by Bluetooth. But the Bluetooth doesn't work suddenly. Manufacture said the printer has something wrong so it should be replaced... But it has already 1year passed when I purchased it. So I have to buy it again... So I cannot use the printer more... I have still more 60 sheets of zink paper... I cannot trust this product.", "This was a gift I bought for my daughter.  For irrelevant reasons it took me a while to contact Fujifilm regarding the error\u2014 Indicator kept saying there is no film pack. I\u2019m actually a Fujifilm consumer, but after this\u2014I may consider Polaroid.  Called and I have to pay to get a replacement\u2014what?! Trash! I wish I would have seen the reddit comments sooner.", "It did not work at all.", "It failed to power up in less than 30 days from receiving it", "I was very excited to have a printer like this. Unfortunately,  the thing is good only in concept. In practice,  the prints were of low quality. They were too dark even when I tried to make them look lighter through the app. Also the battery charge drained too  fast.

Great wallet photos with sticky backs.  You can't expect crazy quality, it has a Polaroid haze to it,  but amazing for travel,  pocket sized, about the size of my phone. The price isn't bad for what you get.  And being able to edit, and choose the photo before wasting paper is awesome!", "I've created so many personal gifts with this paper as the back comes off and turns the print into a sticker!", "The printer is incredible given the size and the price of it. It works in an instant and it's so easy to take with you anywhere. It's honestly one of my favorite devices that I have right now.", "This device is awesome!! Love being able to print a small photo anywhere anytime.", "I have been in love with my sprocket since I got it! The only thing I would say is make sure to get the HP brand zink paper. I got poloriod thinking it would function the same and it would not process it from the blue card. The HP brand paper is the same price so just make sure you get the right one. Besides that I have used this camera more and more to spice up my bullet journal! Small, compact and easy to use. My kind of product!", "This is a cool little gadget, my wife loves it!", "I bought this printer twice (the first was stolen!). It's brilliant!! We use it specifically for traveling with kids. Both my kids take pictures, print them out, then stick them in a journal and write about their trips. It's the highlight of every day.\nIt is SO compact you can carry it everywhere in a purse or backpack. My parents took it backpacking and printed out pictures to stick on postcards to send to my kids, which the kids went nuts for.\nThis is not a replacement for high quality printing from Walmart as the photos are small (stickers) and vary in quality. But this has solidified my kids love of journaling their travels at a young age (3 and 5).\nHighly recommended!!", "Fun printer!", "Already addicted to this product, when through 40 films in the first night, definitely a must buy for anyone with a love for some tangibility and a little nostalgia.  If you are hesitant about buying this don't be, and just pull the trigger and buy it, you won't regret it", "It's awesome!!!", "I had gotten this instant printer to use for a photo booth at my party and it worked so great. My friends really loved it!", "prints super fast and good enough quality for my sony a7 camera", "Very nice photo printer, comes with 10 pages and had enough charge when it arrived to print off one test photo. Charges very quickly- I had several more photos within the half hour. The photos are quick to come out and are adequate to the quality the original photo has. Would recommend for anyone searching for a quick,wireless photo printer", "It's like having a Polaroid. Took it for a trip with my grandkids and we would paste picture in a book daily and then every one would write in it throughout the day. Fun.", "very easy to use", "Great portable little printer. Produces some great little prints and is easy to bring along just about anywhere.", "Surprisingly good pictures in a small package.", "So there are a ton of reviews about this but here is the simple version. It works and works well. Super simple to use; connect via bluetooth, choose your pic, print and a minute later a 2x3 pic comes out. The back side can be removed if you want to stick it on something. Cool stuff.", "This is really cool!!! The price is high but its worth it! It comes with a pack of 10 paper and it takes about 30 seconds to print! The app lets your edit the photo the way you want! It works with my Iphone 6! The battery lasts around 10 prints! My friends all love it :)", "I love how they've made this instant printer with the Earth in mind as it doesn't require a cartridge and the packaging was kept to a minimum!", "Best printer for school labels and pictures I love it I use it for all the childrens id badges and box labeling for their clothes and cubbies.", "I just bought this last week and I have only tried it a few times. I agree with the other positive reviews. I also have the zip, I like that too, but the software was changed and hopefully it is fixed.\nThis connects to wifi and it connected easily.  It is fast and the prints are nice.  I also have the Fiji instant camera and this and the camera both use the same film.\n Photos come out nicely and color is good. Portraits that I printed were lighter in skin tone, the two I printed had little shadows and if you want to look somewhat flawless, this may be the way!\n Honestly, it may have been that those photos were on the light side.\nI like the idea that you can replace and recharge the battery.  Some people have complained about other printers when the rechargeable batteries stopped holding the charge.  This should avoid all of that.\n\nLastly for now, the software is great. Easy to find your photos and nice edit and frames.  Easy to use, no crashes.\nI used this on an iPad Air and older iPhone that does not have the very latest software.\nNot sure what it is.  But, it does work on iPads.  May depend on the software tho.\n\nNice little printer. Have aging parents and grandmother I'm seeing how important it is to them when I send photos. They don't use the net.  We have tried to nudge them. But no.  Even if I send pictures to my sisters, they can show them to our parents . But it's not like have their own photos right there.\nYou can buy multiple photo albums here on Amazon that hold this size print.  Also bought kits that have small frames and other goodies for these prints.\n  Good idea overall.", "So fun to use!! Not professional quality pictures, but great for quick print outs! We set a cooler color setting on the picture before printing because it prints colors a little warm! I would recommend!", "My grand daughter was very pleased.", "I am in love with this blue wireless instant printer for the fact that it quickly prints out some of the nicest shots that I have ever printed!", "I love love this product. I was searching for a polaroid type of camera and decised to buy this because I am guaranteed to get the shots I want.", "I'm a huge fan of how I can keep my memories alive through this printer. Thanks, HP.", "Awesome. Works perfect.", "Excellent. On time", "Every single photo that this printer has printed out thus far is honestly quite impressive. This was such a good buy!", "It's such a great instant printer as I am able to print the photos straight off of my phone as well as my tablet!", "Got this as a gift for my photographer beau and my sister who has little kids and takes a ton of iphone photos. They both love it! Fun and easy to use. The color is a little off but for small keepsakes and wallet photos, it's fine.", "Love this thing!", "Have you ever found yourself looking for the perfect gift for a teenage girl??? A 16 year old girl in this social media, selfie taking, YouTube crazed age we now live in. Well! Here is the gift of all gifts! My sweet sister progressively gets harder to buy for. I was sick of buying a gift, thinking I was a genius, being giddy with excitement only to get the very bleak \"Oh, um, thanks.\" Then finding out a month or so later that gift was either sold, regifted or donated. I just wanted a gift she would actually USE and LOVE for more then 5 min! FINALLY! This did it! She was so excited! Genuinely excited! Happy! Over the moon! She went on and on about the greatest Instagrahmers and Youtubers all have Polaroids. She absolutely loves how small and sleek it is. It fits perfectly in her cute, posh, fringe purse. She loves that she can just connect it to her smart phone!! We live in a world of \"filters\". You can't edit or filter a instant camera BUT you can with your smart phone then print it with this baby!! It also gives you the option of taking a photo and instantly printing instead of choosing that perfect picture from your phone. Oh I should mention that you need an app! Again bought this for a teen sooooo took her all of 5.5 seconds to figure this out. Totally NOT a big deal. She takes it every where, her friends are have added this to thier Christmas wish list, and she's constantly getting requests for friends to try it! I couldn't be happier or have enough good things to say about this product! Seriously! Stop searching for that perfect gift, you've found it!", "Awsome !!! great pictures, easy to use", "For choice photos on your phone that you want printed for a coffee table book, wallet, or to use the sticky back to make a collage, this is great.\nAlong with the paper, this is an affordable way to print and who needs super huge photos when online there are plenty of places you can send your digital media photos to enlarge or make into mugs and T-shirt.  This HP Sprocket is as portable as indicated and a breeze to setup and use right away.  Very simple instructions.  For the cost of it, here is a great gift since everyone has a a smart phone.", "this is a gift but I think it will be good.", "It was very difficult for me to decide on a color, but I ultimately went with the blue one and I couldn't be happier!", "This is a cool little printer.  I'm a gadget guy, and wanted to give this a try.  It's mobile - I throw it in my bag and carry it around everywhere.  Works well by bluetooth, without any problems.  The picture quality is very good, although the pictures themselves are small - I think it's 2 x 3.  Don't expect big pictures from this!  The pictures can be carried in a wallet, or slipped into a purse though.  The cost is fairly reasonable per print, and it's pretty cool when you are with people to haul it out and let see it print.  Only problem is, expect to give away the pictures!  Everyone wants them.", "I have been needing a portable printer for a while now, so I got this red Polaroid one and I love it! It looks amazing while it is so easy to carry around with me. It prints really great photos, too!", "Exactly what I was looking for.  Great for printing my pictures straight from my phone. Love the color. The photo quality is amazing.", "Love this little thing. Wish it came with more paper but it\u2019s super convenient.", "Contrast, Lux depth, Colour accuracy, Clarity are all on top of the heap!  The finest Instax Mini images available are those coming out of this printer!  MY KINGDOM FOR AN INSTAX WIDE FORMAT PRINTER.", "If you're considering the SP-2 as an upgrade from the SP-1, I definitely recommend it.\nA few noticeable changes from the SP-1:\n- the new design feature soft grip feelings on the side while maintaining a sleek look and better stand\n- quieter, faster printing\n- rechargeable battery\n- clearer film count and battery life\n- more contrasted prints\n\nThe only downside I could think of for not getting this printer is if you enjoy the old-timey faded look of original polaroids. Since the SP-2 is a higher resolution printer, the images come out sharper and more contrasted -- which is not a characteristic of traditional polaroid photos.", "Its worth every penny", "Very nice my granddaughter loves it.", "Wow it better than what I expected", "The app is so easy to connect to the printer, so you can have your prints available to you within seconds, regardless of where you are. I'm also pretty happy with the quality of the prints.", "I have owned this for over a year now! Great portable printer that prints nice and crisp photos. 10/10 recommend.", "LOVE IT", "My granddaughter wanted this and loves it.", "I love this printer! The color of the photo is more beautiful than I expected!", "Great way to make pictures into home made cards. Very personalized.", "This was a Christmas gift for our 8 year old daughter.  Originally, she was wanting either the fuji or polaroid instant cameras.  As I started poking around the internet, these small printers seemed to be the better value with their flexibility.  With the printers, multiple people can use the same printer as long as they have their own device that can connect to it.  Makes for pretty easy entertainment among a group of cousins, to say the least.  Ultimately, I was sold on the app that HP offers versus the competition due to the extras.  She loves adding borders and all the items on people's heads and faces.\n\nThe picture quality is what it is.  It won't blow you away, but for a $100 pocket-able printer I wasn't really expecting professional grade photos either.  We have pictures stuck everywhere, great purchase if you are looking to have fun and capture memories with your child.", "I found this to be easy to setup and use.  I'm having fun with this printer and the picture size is perfect for my planner.  Thanks.", "I love it! No negative comments I'm just so in love !", "It took me a long time to choose an instant printer but I am so glad that, in the end, I decided to go with this one.", "This is a very impressive instant printer because the photos all come out quite vibrant and you can really see all of the details in them.", "I love this! I take it everywhere with me.", "Me encanta!", "Great items for Christmas gifts. Bought 2. Shipped in time for Christmas Day!!", "Who would have thought I'd have a little printer small enough to fit in my purse and ber able to share photos instantly, reminds me of the Polaroid era!. Oh the possibilities...scrapbooking, school projects, making fridge magnets! I love it!", "although my package was delivered without the name on it, had a heavy task to find it at the hotel", "I was quite worried about buying this because you have to use the Instax SHARE app to use the printer and some reviewers have said that they weren't able to use the printer at all BUT it works perfectly fine on my iPhone 7. I love the possibilities you have with this printer and the option to choose any photo you like and edit it as well. I also have a Fujifilm Instax Mini 8 and I often times choose the wrong setting, am in a poorly lit setting, and the photos come out bad in general BUT now I am able to take pictures with my phone (or any camera) and print it! In the app as well, there are multiple editing options as well as the ability to split a photo into 2 pictures! Also, before you even buy the printer, you can just download the app and play around with the settings and see how your prints would come out if you were to have a printer.\n(Tip 1: prints usually come out slightly brighter than the original photo.)\n(Tip 2 : you can use practically any digital photo you'd like but you must be able to transfer it onto your device to print it via the Instax SHARE app)", "Easy to use, portable, and chargeable printer for any phone or tablet using bluetooth! Print pictures that are clearer than the Polaroid version and looks so much cuter!", "Love this little thing. Able to print any pic from my phone. Paper is a little expensive but great way to document my life.", "This is a must have for those who are into having hard copies of their pictures. It'll save you lots of money and will allow you to be more creative with the prints, too.", "I've had no issues connecting it to my phone and it prints clearly. In some of the pictures, the prints come out a bit darker, but that's very easy to fix with the filters that come with the\u00a0app.", "What a crowdpleaser this little gadget is! I bought this for a friend who is very much into social media. She brought it to a party and it was a hit to take pictures with guests and give them a memento.  Portable and quick", "I really love this printer! Works with the Bluetooth from my smartphone and connected very easily. The pictures come out very clear and using the Polaroid app, you can edit, crop, use special effects,  add borders and print. I've recommended this printer to everyone I know.", "It's so cool to have these photos easily and conveniently sticking to surfaces that I want them to display on.", "Love this pocket printer.\nThis pictures are kind of small but it does exactly what I need.\nI love that I can print pictures on the go!\nI highly recommend!!!", "My Daughter loves her new little printer and after looking at the pictures I think it's a great gift to have.", "Worked well.", "For a small device such as this printer, the technology it possesses is so massive that I really am blown away printing an all-in-one goodness in a photo. So, I snap a shot, I print it zero hassle and zero minutes (cause it literally prints fast), then I stick it on my memory board or fridge door. It's so cool.", "The colors are great and it doesn\u2019t look grainy at all when you print", "This printer is so much fun! It is so easy to use and the stickers come out high quality.  I am buying a ton more of the sticky paper today... Love this!!", "Love it! Great product!", "Super product, great for any party and vacation pics. Fits in your pocket\ud83d\udc4d", "I absolutely love this! Came precharged and ready to try out, just download the app, load the paper and print. Small and light so you can carry it anywhere. Fast recharge time (1.5 hours to get full charge). This completely met my expectations.", "SUPER CUTE AND EASY", "Worked As Described", "I really love how sleek and compact this instant printer is that way I can print wherever I am.", "This is a cool device, comes in handy for my daughter who is a teacher and can take cute pics and then print and give a \"sticker\" to her students for something special.", "Works great! Fits in my bag and prints images really quickly. Connects to my phone with out any issues. (note I have an iPhone 4s)", "it was a birthday gift for my sister and she loved it", "So much fun. Cute pictures.", "Prints are quicker start to finish on a iPhone 6 over a 5/5S.\nSmall enough to put in a pocket or small bag. When turned off, I usually have to go to the iOS Settings and choose the printer in the Bluetooth area. Like the earlier model, but re-pairing is much faster now.\nPrints are handy when out shooting to share or see how the images will look on paper later. Kids love to get a print as a leave behind when they watch me taking photos of popular areas. I'm getting more than 20 prints between charges.", "This product is amazing! Only thing is that the photos print darker than you expect. So just adjust the picture brightness to print more of what you want.", "Good quality mobile printer. People are saying that the colors are off on the prints. Like what the heck? It's a POLAROID PRINTER lol\nI bought it, I like it, period. Just make sure that the surface you're gonna stick the photos on is flat, otherwise the corners will peel off eventually.", "This little instant printer is quite inexpensive and yet it works so well and it is so easy to use.", "Awesome", "I love it, download the app work as simple as saying  1,2,3 ... Get for project and other ideas with DIY", "I really did not expect this little instant printer to do everything that it can do so it really exceeded my expectations.", "This is a dream. Everyone gets jealous when I pull it out and print an adorable picture of the moment and the quality is shockingly great.", "Bought this as a gift for my aunt after she saw me using the SP3. This size lines up a little better with cellphone pics than the square does. Being a designer, she spent a while geeking out on figuring out the colors and printing. Fortunately, we also got her four packs of film! She's really enjoyed it. These things are great. I will reiterate for Fuji if they're reading, please make an Instax wide printer please.", "Great", "This amazingly little portable printer was a gift for my 24 year old daughter for Christmas. She was surprised and delight to receive it, and has since used it with her friends. It is light weight, quick to set up, has a wonderful app that let's you make edits before printing, and is easy to use. It charges easily and there is NO ink cartridges to replace! The ink is in the paper, which is - IMO - very affordable!", "This is way better than buying a  polaroid camera can just print the photo you chose and edit before printing a definite five stars", "Love it! Beautiful pictures printed in virtually no time. I wish there was a version that printed bigger pictures.", "Gave this to my not so technically advanced mother as a Christmas gift. She recently got an iPhone so I thought this would be a fun idea. I was able to quickly set it up and walk her through it in less than five minutes. She got such a kick out of it. Taking pictures of the family and quickly printing them out. Everyone loved it. I just wish the pictures were a touch bigger, but that's no one's fault. Excellent and fun!", "Fun mini printer to use for projects.", "Portable, nice prints right from my iphone8.", "Excellent", "For person how likes photos is a nice item and very useful", "works very good", "Wonderful!", "This printer charges so quickly with the cord, it's simple to load, and has worked consistently so far! I also like the app that comes with it since it's easy to use. Makes cropping images a breeze.", "Love my new printer.  I can take it with me anywhere.", "An awesome little printer. Clear pictures and prints fast for a small printer.", "I found this printer fairly ease to use and I'm quite impressed with the quality. If you want to make sure that it's good, I'd recommend shooting in locations with good lighting.", "Over the years I've bought cameras, used the film, invested in gear and gained a lot of experience to live to tell the tale. With that said, I can explain to you why this product is what you want vs these small vintage-era portable film cameras offer. I bought this as a mother's day incentive so that whenever a holiday comes around, i can print a photo off and give it to them as a friendly gesture.\n\n1. The quality of the photo taken from your phone, is transported onto this device. Meaning, instead of risking wasting film on trial and error, unsure of what you'll get --- you simply take a photo of anything with your camera, and you can print it off. Easy as that. The better (phone) camera, the better end product.\n\n2. Customization. With the onboard software, which I've reviewed and was thanked by the HPSprocket Team, allows you to edit, critique, or just make a photo something entirely new.\n\n3. Personal Achievements: Sometimes we get rewards from our phone, via a email, video game, or just a simple notification. Instead of screenshotting that and sending it to your friend, asking for the same, equal excitement --- you can print that screenshot off, put it in a photo album, and allow yourself to make a bookmark of achievements. The photos I've provided will show you some of the things I've achieved in this year alone and how this device helps with my accomplishments.\n\n4. Stickers. You can apply stickers to virtually any photo you upload onto your sprocket; even as far as taking photos and turning real life animations/stickers/logos and making you're very OWN stickers to apply to your OWN photos! I hope that makes sense; its easier shown than read. You'll get it once you play with the software\n\n4. Up to date software. This is important among all hardware and film. If the software doesn't work, the hardware and YOU, don't either. Updated frequently, with the ability to upload your own photos in case you need that storage on your phone.\n\n5. Film. inexpensive, slightly small, and wallet sized. Depending on the model device you get, this effects the film length/price. I got this model for the cost of film is independent from buying the device.\n\nCons:\nThe color in the photos isn't always the best, and the device needs to be plugged into something for more than 2-4 photos. but the ability to do some of these things with film is extraordinary in the first place; whats the saying? Don't look a gift horse in the mouth?\n\nWith all these these pros, and slight cons, I would suggest this over film any time. You get to practice using digital film, (your phone or what have you.)  the film is inexpensive, and the virtual customization is in any shape, way, possible.\nSuperb choice for those interested in editing photos.\nThe photos above are things I've done with mine. :)", "It is so easy to use and is compact so it takes up no space at all.", "LOVE LOVE LOVE this! Works great and is perfect for bluetooth too. App is easy!", "I take this printer with me to every event that I host as it works perfectly at homemade photobooths. Everyone always leaves the party feeling happy as they've got a memory that they can hold onto. The prints come out great and they are just the right size, too. It's also so easy to carry around from one place to another!", "This will allow you to take high-quality picture from your phone and print it like polaroid.", "Love this printer. Sometimes the quality of the pic is a little darker, but otherwise clear and crisp", "COOL !!!!!  It really has a nice quality of picture considering there is no ink printer in it. The fact that I don't have to buy ink for it or have the ink dry out in it is really appealing to me.  The back of the pictures has a peel off paper and there is adhesive on the picture,you can stick the picture onto anything. This thing is no bigger than a phone!!! Small enough to carry anywhere.

You need a specific app to print (I have an iPhone) and that's where the issue comes in. The app is notoriously bad - check the reviews for yourself. It's riddled with bugs and the developers clearly don't care. The current update renders the printer completely unusable, because the app crashes each and every time it loads. Seriously, read the reviews.", "when I received mine, it had the instructions and the camera that's it. and when I tried to use it, I noticed there was an empty place where the battery should be! it was supposedly, included, but no. and neither was the charger cord either. this was a gift and it turned out to not work out whatsoever. DONT BUY FROM THIS SELLER.", "If I could I would give it a negative number. I love the idea of having a sticky backing to the pictures.

I started to play around with it, I wanted to be able to use for my son\u2019s birthday party. I went ahead and charged for a few hours, I took a picture as I\u2019m editing this picture within the app (adding text and stickers) which took me about 3 minutes or so..the printer shut off on me, which means that I had to turn on the power back on the printer and then reconnect to Bluetooth what made it even more annoying is that I couldn\u2019t reconnect the printer via Bluetooth within the app! If you can\u2019t do that, then why is there an option on the app?????!!! So I would have to go ahead to my settings and do it that way. This happened to me on every picture! So what\u2019s the point of having the ability to edit a picture if the printer is going to shut off after a certain amount of time, which in my case it was less than 3 minutes?\n\nThe day of the party came. I charged it and figured I would stick it out! The damn printer is dead! So I plugged it in, which in the meantime I took pictures with my phone. When it came time to print the printer would NOT connect to my phone!!!!

Leave it to Polaroid to make me leave a message on a weekend to reach customer service. Hoping that Amazon will allow me to return this so we can be done with this terrible product. Could be user error as technology isn't my strong suit, but if I've tried all troubleshooting options, and nothing has worked, I'd say the product is bad.", "My daughter purchased this product with her own money and she is not happy with the product at all.

I agree with the other positive reviews. I also have the zip, I like that too, but the software was changed and hopefully it is fixed.\nThis connects to wifi and it connected easily.

Portraits that I printed were lighter in skin tone, the two I printed had little shadows and if you want to look somewhat flawless, this may be the way!\n Honestly, it may have been that those photos were on the light side.\nI like the idea that you can replace and recharge the battery.  Some people have complained about other printers when the rechargeable batteries stopped holding the charge.  This should avoid all of that.\n\nLastly for now, the software is great. Easy to find your photos and nice edit and frames.  Easy to use, no crashes.\nI used this on an iPad Air and older iPhone that does not have the very latest software.\nNot sure what it is.  But, it does work on iPads.  May depend on the software tho.\n\nNice little printer. Have aging parents and grandmother I'm seeing how important it is to them when I send photos. They don't use the net.  We have tried to nudge them. But no.  Even if I send pictures to my sisters, they can show them to our parents .

Also bought kits that have small frames and other goodies for these prints.\n  Good idea overall.", "So fun to use!! Not professional quality pictures, but great for quick print outs!

You can't edit or filter a instant camera BUT you can with your smart phone then print it with this baby!! It also gives you the option of taking a photo and instantly printing instead of choosing that perfect picture from your phone. Oh I should mention that you need an app!

For the cost of it, here is a great gift since everyone has a a smart phone.", "this is a gift but I think it will be good.", "It was very difficult for me to decide on a color, but I ultimately went with the blue one and I couldn't be happier!", "This is a cool little printer.  I'm a gadget guy, and wanted to give this a try.  It's mobile - I throw it in my bag and carry it around everywhere.  Works well by bluetooth, without any problems.  The picture quality is very good, although the pictures themselves are small - I think it's 2 x 3.  Don't expect big pictures from this!  The pictures can be carried in a wallet, or slipped into a purse though.  The cost is fairly reasonable per print, and it's pretty cool when you are with people to haul it out and let see it print.  Only problem is, expect to give away the pictures!  Everyone wants them.", "I have been needing a portable printer for a while now, so I got this red Polaroid one and I love it! It looks amazing while it is so easy to carry around with me. It prints really great photos, too!", "Exactly what I was looking for.  Great for printing my pictures straight from my phone.

The finest Instax Mini images available are those coming out of this printer!  MY KINGDOM FOR AN INSTAX WIDE FORMAT PRINTER.", "If you're considering the SP-2 as an upgrade from the SP-1, I definitely recommend it.\nA few noticeable changes from the SP-1:\n- the new design feature soft grip feelings on the side while maintaining a sleek look and better stand\n- quieter, faster printing\n- rechargeable battery\n- clearer film count and battery life\n- more contrasted prints\n\nThe only downside I could think of for not getting this printer is if you enjoy the old-timey faded look of original polaroids. Since the SP-2 is a higher resolution printer, the images come out sharper and more contrasted -- which is not a characteristic of traditional polaroid photos.", "Its worth every penny", "Very nice my granddaughter loves it.", "Wow it better than what I expected", "The app is so easy to connect to the printer, so you can have your prints available to you within seconds, regardless of where you are.

The color of the photo is more beautiful than I expected!", "Great way to make pictures into home made cards. Very personalized.", "This was a Christmas gift for our 8 year old daughter.  Originally, she was wanting either the fuji or polaroid instant cameras.  As I started poking around the internet, these small printers seemed to be the better value with their flexibility.  With the printers, multiple people can use the same printer as long as they have their own device that can connect to it.  Makes for pretty easy entertainment among a group of cousins, to say the least.  Ultimately, I was sold on the app that HP offers versus the competition due to the extras.  She loves adding borders and all the items on people's heads and faces.\n\nThe picture quality is what it is.  It won't blow you away, but for a $100 pocket-able printer I wasn't really expecting professional grade photos either.  We have pictures stuck everywhere, great purchase if you are looking to have fun and capture memories with your child.", "I found this to be easy to setup and use.

I love it!", "although my package was delivered without the name on it, had a heavy task to find it at the hotel", "I was quite worried about buying this because you have to use the Instax SHARE app to use the printer and some reviewers have said that they weren't able to use the printer at all BUT it works perfectly fine on my iPhone 7. I love the possibilities you have with this printer and the option to choose any photo you like and edit it as well. I also have a Fujifilm Instax Mini 8 and I often times choose the wrong setting, am in a poorly lit setting, and the photos come out bad in general BUT now I am able to take pictures with my phone (or any camera) and print it! In the app as well, there are multiple editing options as well as the ability to split a photo into 2 pictures! Also, before you even buy the printer, you can just download the app and play around with the settings and see how your prints would come out if you were to have a printer.\n(Tip 1: prints usually come out slightly brighter than the original photo.)\n(Tip 2 : you can use practically any digital photo you'd like but you must be able to transfer it onto your device to print it via the Instax SHARE app)", "Easy to use, portable, and chargeable printer for any phone or tablet using bluetooth!

Portable and quick", "I really love this printer! Works with the Bluetooth from my smartphone and connected very easily.

Cute pictures.", "Prints are quicker start to finish on a iPhone 6 over a 5/5S.\nSmall enough to put in a pocket or small bag. When turned off, I usually have to go to the iOS Settings and choose the printer in the Bluetooth area. Like the earlier model, but re-pairing is much faster now.\nPrints are handy when out shooting to share or see how the images will look on paper later. Kids love to get a print as a leave behind when they watch me taking photos of popular areas. I'm getting more than 20 prints between charges.", "This product is amazing! Only thing is that the photos print darker than you expect. So just adjust the picture brightness to print more of what you want.", "Good quality mobile printer. People are saying that the colors are off on the prints. Like what the heck? It's a POLAROID PRINTER lol\nI bought it, I like it, period.

This size lines up a little better with cellphone pics than the square does. Being a designer, she spent a while geeking out on figuring out the colors and printing.

I will reiterate for Fuji if they're reading, please make an Instax wide printer please.", "Great", "This amazingly little portable printer was a gift for my 24 year old daughter for Christmas. She was surprised and delight to receive it, and has since used it with her friends. It is light weight, quick to set up, has a wonderful app that let's you make edits before printing, and is easy to use. It charges easily and there is NO ink cartridges to replace! The ink is in the paper, which is - IMO - very affordable!", "This is way better than buying a  polaroid camera can just print the photo you chose and edit before printing a definite five stars", "Love it! Beautiful pictures printed in virtually no time. I wish there was a version that printed bigger pictures.", "Gave this to my not so technically advanced mother as a Christmas gift. She recently got an iPhone so I thought this would be a fun idea. I was able to quickly set it up and walk her through it in less than five minutes. She got such a kick out of it.

Clear pictures and prints fast for a small printer.", "I found this printer fairly ease to use and I'm quite impressed with the quality. If you want to make sure that it's good, I'd recommend shooting in locations with good lighting.", "Over the years I've bought cameras, used the film, invested in gear and gained a lot of experience to live to tell the tale. With that said, I can explain to you why this product is what you want vs these small vintage-era portable film cameras offer. I bought this as a mother's day incentive so that whenever a holiday comes around, i can print a photo off and give it to them as a friendly gesture.\n\n1. The quality of the photo taken from your phone, is transported onto this device. Meaning, instead of risking wasting film on trial and error, unsure of what you'll get --- you simply take a photo of anything with your camera, and you can print it off. Easy as that. The better (phone) camera, the better end product.\n\n2. Customization. With the onboard software, which I've reviewed and was thanked by the HPSprocket Team, allows you to edit, critique, or just make a photo something entirely new.\n\n3. Personal Achievements: Sometimes we get rewards from our phone, via a email, video game, or just a simple notification. Instead of screenshotting that and sending it to your friend, asking for the same, equal excitement --- you can print that screenshot off, put it in a photo album, and allow yourself to make a bookmark of achievements. The photos I've provided will show you some of the things I've achieved in this year alone and how this device helps with my accomplishments.\n\n4. Stickers. You can apply stickers to virtually any photo you upload onto your sprocket; even as far as taking photos and turning real life animations/stickers/logos and making you're very OWN stickers to apply to your OWN photos! I hope that makes sense; its easier shown than read. You'll get it once you play with the software\n\n4. Up to date software. This is important among all hardware and film. If the software doesn't work, the hardware and YOU, don't either. Updated frequently, with the ability to upload your own photos in case you need that storage on your phone.\n\n5. Film. inexpensive, slightly small, and wallet sized. Depending on the model device you get, this effects the film length/price. I got this model for the cost of film is independent from buying the device.\n\nCons:\nThe color in the photos isn't always the best, and the device needs to be plugged into something for more than 2-4 photos. but the ability to do some of these things with film is extraordinary in the first place; whats the saying? Don't look a gift horse in the mouth?\n\nWith all these these pros, and slight cons, I would suggest this over film any time. You get to practice using digital film, (your phone or what have you.)  the film is inexpensive, and the virtual customization is in any shape, way, possible.\nSuperb choice for those interested in editing photos.\nThe photos above are things I've done with mine. :)", "It is so easy to use and is compact so it takes up no space at all.", "LOVE LOVE LOVE this! Works great and is perfect for bluetooth too. App is easy!", "I take this printer with me to every event that I host as it works perfectly at homemade photobooths. Everyone always leaves the party feeling happy as they've got a memory that they can hold onto. The prints come out great and they are just the right size, too. It's also so easy to carry around from one place to another!", "This will allow you to take high-quality picture from your phone and print it like polaroid.", "Love this printer. Sometimes the quality of the pic is a little darker, but otherwise clear and crisp", "COOL !!!!!  It really has a nice quality of picture considering there is no ink printer in it. The fact that I don't have to buy ink for it or have the ink dry out in it is really appealing to me.  The back of the pictures has a peel off paper and there is adhesive on the picture,you can stick the picture onto anything. This thing is no bigger than a phone!!! Small enough to carry anywhere.

Not as good as the old Polaroid cameras but good enough.", "The pictures often come out darker and sometimes too saturated so I edit them on my phone and make them lighter to counteract the darkening.

Both my kids take pictures, print them out, then stick them in a journal and write about their trips. It's the highlight of every day.\nIt is SO compact you can carry it everywhere in a purse or backpack. My parents took it backpacking and printed out pictures to stick on postcards to send to my kids, which the kids went nuts for.\nThis is not a replacement for high quality printing from Walmart as the photos are small (stickers) and vary in quality.

I agree with the other positive reviews. I also have the zip, I like that too, but the software was changed and hopefully it is fixed.\nThis connects to wifi and it connected easily.  It is fast and the prints are nice.  I also have the Fiji instant camera and this and the camera both use the same film.\n Photos come out nicely and color is good. Portraits that I printed were lighter in skin tone, the two I printed had little shadows and if you want to look somewhat flawless, this may be the way!\n Honestly, it may have been that those photos were on the light side.\nI like the idea that you can replace and recharge the battery.  Some people have complained about other printers when the rechargeable batteries stopped holding the charge.  This should avoid all of that.\n\nLastly for now, the software is great. Easy to find your photos and nice edit and frames.  Easy to use, no crashes.\nI used this on an iPad Air and older iPhone that does not have the very latest software.\nNot sure what it is.  But, it does work on iPads.  May depend on the software tho.\n\nNice little printer. Have aging parents and grandmother I'm seeing how important it is to them when I send photos. They don't use the net.  We have tried to nudge them. But no.  Even if I send pictures to my sisters, they can show them to our parents . But it's not like have their own photos right there.\nYou can buy multiple photo albums here on Amazon that hold this size print.  Also bought kits that have small frames and other goodies for these prints.\n  Good idea overall.", "So fun to use!! Not professional quality pictures, but great for quick print outs!

I just wanted a gift she would actually USE and LOVE for more then 5 min! FINALLY! This did it! She was so excited! Genuinely excited! Happy! Over the moon! She went on and on about the greatest Instagrahmers and Youtubers all have Polaroids. She absolutely loves how small and sleek it is. It fits perfectly in her cute, posh, fringe purse. She loves that she can just connect it to her smart phone!! We live in a world of \"filters\". You can't edit or filter a instant camera BUT you can with your smart phone then print it with this baby!! It also gives you the option of taking a photo and instantly printing instead of choosing that perfect picture from your phone. Oh I should mention that you need an app! Again bought this for a teen sooooo took her all of 5.5 seconds to figure this out. Totally NOT a big deal. She takes it every where, her friends are have added this to thier Christmas wish list, and she's constantly getting requests for friends to try it!

I'm a gadget guy, and wanted to give this a try.  It's mobile - I throw it in my bag and carry it around everywhere.  Works well by bluetooth, without any problems.  The picture quality is very good, although the pictures themselves are small - I think it's 2 x 3.  Don't expect big pictures from this!  The pictures can be carried in a wallet, or slipped into a purse though.  The cost is fairly reasonable per print, and it's pretty cool when you are with people to haul it out and let see it print.  Only problem is, expect to give away the pictures!  Everyone wants them.", "I have been needing a portable printer for a while now, so I got this red Polaroid one and I love it!

Since the SP-2 is a higher resolution printer, the images come out sharper and more contrasted -- which is not a characteristic of traditional polaroid photos.", "Its worth every penny", "Very nice my granddaughter loves it.", "Wow it better than what I expected", "The app is so easy to connect to the printer, so you can have your prints available to you within seconds, regardless of where you are.

The color of the photo is more beautiful than I expected!", "Great way to make pictures into home made cards. Very personalized.", "This was a Christmas gift for our 8 year old daughter.  Originally, she was wanting either the fuji or polaroid instant cameras.  As I started poking around the internet, these small printers seemed to be the better value with their flexibility.  With the printers, multiple people can use the same printer as long as they have their own device that can connect to it.  Makes for pretty easy entertainment among a group of cousins, to say the least.  Ultimately, I was sold on the app that HP offers versus the competition due to the extras.  She loves adding borders and all the items on people's heads and faces.\n\nThe picture quality is what it is.  It won't blow you away, but for a $100 pocket-able printer I wasn't really expecting professional grade photos either.

I also have a Fujifilm Instax Mini 8 and I often times choose the wrong setting, am in a poorly lit setting, and the photos come out bad in general BUT now I am able to take pictures with my phone (or any camera) and print it! In the app as well, there are multiple editing options as well as the ability to split a photo into 2 pictures!

When turned off, I usually have to go to the iOS Settings and choose the printer in the Bluetooth area. Like the earlier model, but re-pairing is much faster now.\nPrints are handy when out shooting to share or see how the images will look on paper later. Kids love to get a print as a leave behind when they watch me taking photos of popular areas. I'm getting more than 20 prints between charges.", "This product is amazing! Only thing is that the photos print darker than you expect. So just adjust the picture brightness to print more of what you want.", "Good quality mobile printer. People are saying that the colors are off on the prints. Like what the heck? It's a POLAROID PRINTER lol\nI bought it, I like it, period. Just make sure that the surface you're gonna stick the photos on is flat, otherwise the corners will peel off eventually.", "This little instant printer is quite inexpensive and yet it works so well and it is so easy to use.", "Awesome", "I love it, download the app work as simple as saying  1,2,3 ... Get for project and other ideas with DIY", "I really did not expect this little instant printer to do everything that it can do so it really exceeded my expectations.", "This is a dream. Everyone gets jealous when I pull it out and print an adorable picture of the moment and the quality is shockingly great.", "Bought this as a gift for my aunt after she saw me using the SP3. This size lines up a little better with cellphone pics than the square does. Being a designer, she spent a while geeking out on figuring out the colors and printing. Fortunately, we also got her four packs of film! She's really enjoyed it. These things are great. I will reiterate for Fuji if they're reading, please make an Instax wide printer please.", "Great", "This amazingly little portable printer was a gift for my 24 year old daughter for Christmas. She was surprised and delight to receive it, and has since used it with her friends. It is light weight, quick to set up, has a wonderful app that let's you make edits before printing, and is easy to use. It charges easily and there is NO ink cartridges to replace! The ink is in the paper, which is - IMO - very affordable!", "This is way better than buying a  polaroid camera can just print the photo you chose and edit before printing a definite five stars", "Love it! Beautiful pictures printed in virtually no time. I wish there was a version that printed bigger pictures.", "Gave this to my not so technically advanced mother as a Christmas gift. She recently got an iPhone so I thought this would be a fun idea. I was able to quickly set it up and walk her through it in less than five minutes. She got such a kick out of it. Taking pictures of the family and quickly printing them out. Everyone loved it. I just wish the pictures were a touch bigger, but that's no one's fault. Excellent and fun!", "Fun mini printer to use for projects.", "Portable, nice prints right from my iphone8.", "Excellent", "For person how likes photos is a nice item and very useful", "works very good", "Wonderful!", "This printer charges so quickly with the cord, it's simple to load, and has worked consistently so far! I also like the app that comes with it since it's easy to use. Makes cropping images a breeze.", "Love my new printer.  I can take it with me anywhere.", "An awesome little printer. Clear pictures and prints fast for a small printer.", "I found this printer fairly ease to use and I'm quite impressed with the quality. If you want to make sure that it's good, I'd recommend shooting in locations with good lighting.", "Over the years I've bought cameras, used the film, invested in gear and gained a lot of experience to live to tell the tale. With that said, I can explain to you why this product is what you want vs these small vintage-era portable film cameras offer. I bought this as a mother's day incentive so that whenever a holiday comes around, i can print a photo off and give it to them as a friendly gesture.\n\n1. The quality of the photo taken from your phone, is transported onto this device. Meaning, instead of risking wasting film on trial and error, unsure of what you'll get --- you simply take a photo of anything with your camera, and you can print it off. Easy as that. The better (phone) camera, the better end product.\n\n2. Customization. With the onboard software, which I've reviewed and was thanked by the HPSprocket Team, allows you to edit, critique, or just make a photo something entirely new.\n\n3. Personal Achievements: Sometimes we get rewards from our phone, via a email, video game, or just a simple notification. Instead of screenshotting that and sending it to your friend, asking for the same, equal excitement --- you can print that screenshot off, put it in a photo album, and allow yourself to make a bookmark of achievements. The photos I've provided will show you some of the things I've achieved in this year alone and how this device helps with my accomplishments.\n\n4. Stickers. You can apply stickers to virtually any photo you upload onto your sprocket; even as far as taking photos and turning real life animations/stickers/logos and making you're very OWN stickers to apply to your OWN photos! I hope that makes sense; its easier shown than read. You'll get it once you play with the software\n\n4. Up to date software. This is important among all hardware and film. If the software doesn't work, the hardware and YOU, don't either. Updated frequently, with the ability to upload your own photos in case you need that storage on your phone.\n\n5. Film. inexpensive, slightly small, and wallet sized. Depending on the model device you get, this effects the film length/price. I got this model for the cost of film is independent from buying the device.\n\nCons:\nThe color in the photos isn't always the best, and the device needs to be plugged into something for more than 2-4 photos. but the ability to do some of these things with film is extraordinary in the first place; whats the saying? Don't look a gift horse in the mouth?\n\nWith all these these pros, and slight cons, I would suggest this over film any time. You get to practice using digital film, (your phone or what have you.)  the film is inexpensive, and the virtual customization is in any shape, way, possible.\nSuperb choice for those interested in editing photos.\nThe photos above are things I've done with mine. :)", "It is so easy to use and is compact so it takes up no space at all.", "LOVE LOVE LOVE this! Works great and is perfect for bluetooth too. App is easy!", "I take this printer with me to every event that I host as it works perfectly at homemade photobooths. Everyone always leaves the party feeling happy as they've got a memory that they can hold onto. The prints come out great and they are just the right size, too. It's also so easy to carry around from one place to another!", "This will allow you to take high-quality picture from your phone and print it like polaroid.", "Love this printer. Sometimes the quality of the pic is a little darker, but otherwise clear and crisp", "COOL !!!!!  It really has a nice quality of picture considering there is no ink printer in it. The fact that I don't have to buy ink for it or have the ink dry out in it is really appealing to me.  The back of the pictures has a peel off paper and there is adhesive on the picture,you can stick the picture onto anything. This thing is no bigger than a phone!!! Small enough to carry anywhere.  I like everything about the Zip.."], "hoffset": 10, "voffset": 10}, {"type": "toptoolbar"}]});
