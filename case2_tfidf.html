Cell phones take amazing photos these days, but they can run 10x the cost of this little camera.  You get to hold your photo in your hand almost immediately, rather than just having another in your online stash.  It takes you back to the old Polaroid days.", "We LOVE that this camera prints photo stickers in under 30 seconds (that don't need to be flapped around or left to develop like the Polaroids I saw a couple years ago). It arrived charged enough for us to play with it right out of the box and comes with 10 photo sheets. We immediately tested it by taking a photo of our dog before getting pics for our youngest of her with each of her three family members. She loved being able to peel the backing off and stick them right on her play kitchen. We are pleased with the photo quality and the auto-flash (which turned on or didn't depending on which way relative to the window we faced the camera). And I'm enjoying this incredible combination of a blast from the past (I'm a 90s kid) and modern technology.\nThis is great for people who love gadgets, families, high schoolers, and teachers who need to print photos of kids for cubbies and the like. It would also be an awesome way to create personalized party favors for guests - just snap a photo of the birthday kid and the guest and hand the guest the printout!\nYes, the sheets are about $.50 each, but last time I checked, a standard photo printer cost $.30-.50 to print a photo. That doesn't provide instant gratification, it doesn't include a sticker backing, and it isn't available on the go no matter where you are.\nSome tips:\n-The CLIQ+ offers more features but it also uploads your photos to Canon (and Canon has rights to them!), or at least can based on the user agreement. This one is not connected to anything via Bluetooth or Wifi.\n-The viewfinder is just slightly off-center from what prints. There's a barely visible guide in there, so look for that before framing your subjects.\n-It's super easy to press the shutter button, so be careful! I accidentally got a sideways picture of my staircase.", "This little camera is great for novelty situations, but isn't really a viable option for those who want great pictures. The paper isn't cheap and the picture quality is really lacking. In fact, I would say the traditional Polaroids are better quality than these are.  Perhaps the long term fading isn't quite the same, but I wasn't real impressed with this camera.  If you want to have the assurance that your pictures aren't floating around cyberspace, or the fun of seeing them printed out instantly, it could be worth it.  If you are looking for high quality instant photos, I don't think you this will work for you.", "Great little camera!", "On the surface this might look like a great stocking stuffer. But the reality in execution is anything but.. Yes this is a digital camera that will write images to an SD card (not included). BUT - the camera will not take a picture unless you have the Zink paper loaded in. Every button push prints out a photo at a cost of .50 per shutter activation. If you're thinking this might be a fun toy for a kid, think again. Printing is not optional.\n\nThe 5 megapixel sensor is also very low quality, producing images that remind me of the front sensor one might see on a cheap imported smartphone. Even moderately lit scenes produce lots of noise in dark areas on the digital image, and the printed images are washed out and bland.\n\nWhat's worse is that despite having a printer on board it can't connect up to anything else. There's no bluetooth for printing out smartphone photographs, and all its onboard USB connection does is charge the camera.\n\nIn short this is not worth the purchase. The $160 step up from this one (called the Cliq+) might be worth considering given that it does allow printing from other devices and includes a flash that this device lacks.", "I know this camera has a lot of negative reviews, but I didn't have any issues. It worked perfectly for me. The picture is a perfct wallet size (2inx3in), and while they aren't as clear or as detailed at digital I didn't expect them to be. For a polaroid camera they were great, and my kiddos seem to love it!", "This product is suppose to bring the polaroid style with the digital camera. I mean it is a decent size and doesn't come with a carrying case but it does come with a wrist band. It also comes with 10 blank picture cards. When I took the picture it doesn't give a real indication on when it will print out. It just has light on top which will show that. One of the biggest things about this is the capture button is way too sensitive and once you take the picture you literally can't tell the camera to print or not to print so it will auto print whatever picture it takes. There is a small mirror in the front for selfies. Although for the price you pay for the camera, I really wish you had a screen to really see the picture you are taking since you literally have no idea if the picture looks good or not and it will just print it out. It does have a micro SD slot for you to store the picture. Overall I do not think this is a great camera to have. It had decent quality picture if you have a steady hand in my opinion. I do think this product could use some work and give you a bit more features for the price you pay.", "Camera with poor image quality will not enjoy handling it.  Do not waste your money buying this product.  Poor Image Quality", "The design is just perfect as it makes it easy to carry around everywhere that you go. It is a stunning camera, too.", "I am obsessed with the look of this red instant print camera. I personally use it a lot to take selfies because they always come out looking so great thanks to this camera!", "I love this camera! It's the right size to fit in your pocket or purse.", "I love how small this instant print camera is that way I can take it with me on all of my trips. All that it needs is the paper, too!", "This camera reminds me of the fun I used to have with Polaroid cameras back in the day. Of course, the size of this camera is a fraction of the size those old cameras were and actually easier to use. However, much like those old Polaroids this camera definitely has its limitations.\n\nThe biggest limitation is that you can only really use it for close-in shots if you want to see any detail, especially considering how small the actual prints are. If you try taking any pics from more than 15' away or so it becomes impossible to see any real detail or identify anyone in the picture.\n\nIt is a great selfie camera and is a lot of fun to use when you are out with friends. The photos paper is pretty expensive though, just like with Polaroids. Just be sure to keep that in mind. If you want to be able to take close-in pics and print them out instantly without having to carry around a separate printer, this is about the best choice out there right now.", "This camera takes not so great photos, but I don't think the point is to have a beautiful perfect picture.  It's on par or slightly better than most of the polaroids Ive taken.  It's compact, although not compared to modern day phones and digital cameras.  Super simple, turn it on, press the button, and it prints, that's about all there is to it.  Refills aren't bad, running about 50 cents per print (2\" x 3\")", "This is such a cute, blue instant print camera! However, apart from its looks, it is also so easy to operate and it produces such quality photos.", "Pretty fun. My young teen likes it.", "I wanted to be able to get a camera that could take decent instant photos to hang or use as a sticker right then and there. With the advent of the digital age, I take lots of pictures, but end up printing very few, so I wanted something I could have fun with here and there.\n\nWhen I got this Canon IVY CLIQ Instant Camera Printer, it was easy to charge using their included cord, and simple to install the included 10-pack of photo paper, which also has the option of using them as an instant sticker. After taking a few pictures in bright light conditions (and a couple in lower light conditions, as well), it quickly became apparent that none of the pictures were going to be good quality. It's bad. I mean, I knew they weren't going to be like digital photos, but I expected at least old-style Polaroid quality, or something similar to that. The colors weren't even close to on-point, details are not distinct at all even when taken up close, and ALL pictures just look like they're...faded/fuzzy, for lack of a better term?\n\nI'm going to let my youngest son play around with the rest of the pictures, but I honestly don't see much point in getting more paper for this. If it can't even print a half-way decent picture anywhere close to the quality that I could get in the 80's with an old Polaroid camera, what's the point? At this price point, there's no value for this at all, not to mention that the paper you need to buy to replenish your meager 10-pack supply isn't cheap, either.\n\nWhile this technically \"works\" and is \"easy to use,\" I expected much, MUCH better from Canon. It's just a junky toy, and you can get far nicer toys at this price. Would not recommend at all, which really bums me out, as I wanted to love this.", "My daughter bought a Fuji Instax camera a couple of years ago. All of her friends have one, too. Any comparisons that I make will be with the Instax. The kids who use the Instax want printed pictures NOW. The quality of the Instax pictures is just so-so, but they get the pictures immediately. The quality of the pictures from the Cliq is just so-so, too. They're a little larger than the Instax ones plus these are stickers if you want to use them that way. You can always leave the sticker backing on them and keep them just as small pictures. This camera is priced about the same as some of the Instax versions, though you can get some models for cheaper. The film prices is about the same, too. The biggest advantage that I see with this over the Instax is the size of the camera. My daughter likes to take her Instax with her, but the size is cumbersome. The Cliq is about the size of a cell phone and can fit in your pocket or purse without any issues. A lot of times my daughter leaves her Instax at home because she doesn't want to deal with it. So if you're considering getting an instant print camera and know that the picture quality isn't going to be very high, then I think this camera is a serious contender.", "**See my review of the IVY Cliq+ for a much better alternative.**\n\nThe IVY Cliq is a fixed-focus camera that takes a 5 megapixel digital photograph and then immediately prints it out on proprietary, tiny photo paper that can also be used as a sticker. It's Canon's alternative to the popular Instax toy \"cameras.\"\n\nFirst, the positives. The photos printed quickly, and did not bleed or run at all. The form factor is good, and the build quality feels solid. The prints are slightly larger than with an Instax, and the camera has an SD card slot.\n\nNow, for the negatives. First and foremost, this takes terrible photos. Color rendition was - in some cases - radically off. Even when the colors weren't terrible, they were often washed out. No one expects high resolution from a fixed-focus camera, but the image quality was far below what I would expect for a $100 device. It's hard to tell if the issue is with the camera itself, or with the ZINK paper (which I suspect is the more likely culprit).\n\nIn addition, it is far too easy to accidentally snap a picture, which not only means wasting paper, it also means having to wait for that photo to print before you can take the shot you want. Even if it meant a higher price, a MUCH better option would be a camera with a screen that allows you to choose which photos you want to print.\n\nAt half the price this might be a fun toy to give to a young person wanting to decorate their notebooks and their lockers with oddly-shaded photos of friends. You might also use it when packing for a move or storage, to take a picture of the contents of a box and then slap that picture on the lid.\n\nNonetheless, in a world where nearly everyone shopping for this product has a phone that take much, much better photos, it's hard to find a niche for a product that performs this poorly.", "This is an awesome camera.  It is great that you can click a photo and then print from your camera.  The quality of the pic is nice.  It is great to use to photos for a scrape book or a photo album...  The yellow is awesome.  You will be able to find it anywhere.  A must have...", "As my screen name indicates I am a career professional photographer, published in numerous newspapers and magazines. Why would I have the slightest interest in this camera? Because it has a purpose, and sadly, based on reading several reviews it appears there are too many expectations for it to be something it was never intended to be.\n\nPICTURE QUALITY\n\nI have taught photo workshops for 13 years. One of my strongest beliefs is that cameras don't take pictures, people do. Why even mention that this has a fixed focus lens or that it is rated as 5 megapixels? Neither is important. More megapixels don't make better pictures, and what this camera has is more than capable of producing the 2x3 inch pictures it's intended to make. Those photo stickers ARE the final result, the user will never make poster size enlargements to warrant needing any higher resolution. And taking into consideration the intended user of this camera, not being able to change the fixed focus lens is actually an advantage.\n\nCOMPARISON TO SMARTPHONES\n\nAgain, there are comments totally missing the point of the Cliq. Sure everyone has a smartphone and sure most of those have impressive cameras, and sure you can take a picture then take it home and edit it and print out a nice full page image on glossy photo paper using a couple of dollars worth of ink and paper. But you can't use a smartphone to snap a pic of your BFF making a silly face at you between classes and instantly print out a couple of stickers you both can put on your locker door. Will those pics look like the cover of Rolling Stone? No, and who cares - if you don't get that you're not the right person to own this camera anyway.\n\nFEATURES\n\nMy opinion is who cares if it has a high resolution viewfinder or lacks a bunch of knobs and dials like a $600 Canon Powershot G7x Mark II, it's a waste of time trying to compare them, so I won't.\n\nHERE\u2019S WHAT YOU WANT TO KNOW\n\nHere are my own observations based on the hands-on facts of actually using it\n\n1. The look, feel and quality of the camera are what you expect from a name brand like Canon, it does not feel cheap or toylike.\n\n2. The number of well-labeled buttons and controls is minimal - a power switch that you have to hold down for a few seconds to prevent turning it on accidentally, the shutter button, a button to select picture size and a reprint button. Someone mentioned that they kept accidentally pressing the shutter button by mistake.  Of course that's user error, but the simple answer is that they shouldn't leave the camera turned on between uses, if the power switch is properly turned off between uses it is impossible to accidentally press the shutter button.\n\n3. There is absolutely nothing technical or complicated about it.  That's the way it is designed and in my opinion that makes it perfect for non-techies.\n\n4. There is no cover on the lens to break or lose.  There is a tiny mirror next to the lens for selfies.  Both are advantages.\n\n5. A short charging cable is included but not a charger. They assume you already have one, but I think they are wrong.  Someone who buys this thing is probably not a high tech person who has a drawer full of spare chargers.\n\n6. The instruction sheet is mostly illustrations and very simplistic, another bad assumption on Canon's part.  Someone who gets this camera may have never seen one before in their life. They need to do a better job explaining what it is and give more fun examples of how to use it.\n\n7. People who grew up using cameras and phones with LCD viewfinder screens will be lost and think this camera is impossible to use without one.  Try to remember that for 100 years people took family photos with simple box cameras that had only one button and no viewfinder screen.  Also remember that with those cameras, just like this one, you couldn't see your pictures until after you waited a week while they were \"developed\" and every picture you took (good or bad) got printed and you paid for each of them regardless if they turned out good.  That retro vibe is one of the cool endearing qualities Canon has brought back here in a world of hurry up, instant gratification and the need for everything to be \"perfect\".\n\n8. This camera uses Zink film, something created by Polaroid almost 30 years ago and is what most of the instant cameras made by Polaroid are using even today.  It is reasonably priced and universally available.  Zink has the advantage of being smudge-proof, water-resistant, and tear-resistant and has a sticky back for instant fun.  It's not designed for serious photography and no one will ever say it's the best film ever.  The limitation with this camera is not the lens or megapixels, it is the Zink film itself.  Now that being said, are the pictures terrible?  No, in fact they surprised me with their color saturation and sharpness.  The first one I took was a closeup of my cat backlit against a bright sunny window, a challenge for any camera, and it turned out surprisingly well. My second shot was of the flowers on my patio table, the colors are accurate, clear and the photo is sharp even though I was only about two feet away.  I included samples of these because seeing real photos is better than reading someone's opinion. Keep in mind these pictures happen in an  instant and you never have to buy expensive printer ink.\n\n9. You may be shocked that the rated battery life is only 25 photos per charge.  There are two things to keep in mind.  One is that this camera prints every picture you take so you\u2019re not going to be snapping dozens of the same shot over and over.  It takes only a speedy one minute to print each picture (faster than any other way I know of to get a decent color photo) and each pak of Zink paper is only 10 sheets.  You can buy large economy sizes but the camera itself only holds 10 at a time. The other thing is the printing process uses heat, which uses up battery life quickly, so remember to turn the power switch off when not actually taking photos, which will also assure that your finger won't accidentally press the shutter button by mistake.  This is a specialized camera so it won\u2019t be your one and only everyday travel camera but rather it will be the one to use for those times when you really want to make instant photo prints, like to use as a refrigerator sticky \"magnet\" of your kids, pets or travels.\n\nTHE FAIRYTALE THAT THESE PICTURES ARE EXPENSIVE\n\nOver and over I keep seeing the untrue statement being made that Zink paper is expensive and therefore this camera is too expensive to use.  The reality of analyzing that starts with the simple fact that these days only about 5% of people who take pictures for personal use make color prints of them, which probably explains why due to inexperience they have no frame of reference how much it costs for photo prints.  I called a couple of photo centers in town and was told that they charge an average of 49 cents and up.  Mail order places cost even more after postage.  The TOTAL cost of printing a photo at home considering paper, ink, ink waste, etc. can start at about 50 cents and go as high as two dollars for the typical common size.  Now compare that to a Zink photo printed on a Canon camera, which requires zero ink (get it, Zink means Zero Ink).  Each print costs 50 cents and you only pay for the pictures you actually take. .  But what everyone is missing is that every other method of printing requires taking your memory card (or film) somewhere and waiting for it to be printed, none of them produce a full color photograph a few seconds after you take it so you can share it and enjoy it.  The bottom line is that comparing this camera to anything else and saying that it is \u201cexpensive\u201d simply doesn\u2019t make sense.\n\nIS IT A TOY\n\nNo it is definitely not a toy, but neither is it a precision photojournalist's instrument either. It's basically what our parents and grandparents used to call a box camera, and no one ever considered those to be toys. I would call it a fun cam, designed and intended for fun loving people, whether they be pre-teens, millennials or Golden Agers - someone who just wants to capture and share a moment with friends and family, who isn't going to take a magnifying glass out and whine that the picture is a little soft or not perfectly exposed. It's the Polaroid camera for today's world, and by the way for those with short memories those old Polaroids were constantly criticized for their so-called poor picture quality yet these days some of those instant photos are hanging in galleries and museums.\n\nMY PROFESSIONAL OPINION\n\nIf you don't understand what this camera is, don't buy it. If you're a pixel peeper or camera snob or thinks it will replace your smartphone or compact travel camera, you don't get it and that's all right. It's not for you. Me, I'm having a ton of fun with it and I compliment Canon on helping to bring back the giggles of instant photography.", "This is a pretty cool little camera. The photo quality is not exceptional, but being able to instantly have a real picture is pretty cool. Photo paper is really expensive so you definitely need to pick your shots. I wanted to let me kids use this, but would be blowing through money.", "I use this camera all the time, especially for selfies. It comes with both a mirror and an auto flash which really helps make sure that all of my selfies come out looking amazing. I also really like the color of my camera. I have gotten so many compliments for it, too!", "I've used this camera for a few weeks now, it's nothing crazy to rave about, but for the idea it's not bad.\n\nFirst off, the camera is made of all plastic and feels cheaply made, so I wouldn't rate it too highly in the durability department.  It prints your pictures instantly and as a note, just like the old polaroid cameras, once you take a picture, you have to wait for it to finish printing before you can take another picture.  Every picture you take gets stored on an SD card if you insert it, but the picture quality stored on the SD card is comparable to what my cellphone ten years ago took.  The picture is not crystal clear, but you can still tell what the picture is of.  On the back of the camera you have a button where you can choose to take a picture that is 2\"x3\" or 2\"x2\".  I'm not sure what the purpose of the 2x2 picture is since it prints on the paper as a 2x2 picture with a blank white one inch bar on the right.  On the front of the camera is a little mirror that is pretty accurate at showing you what you're taking a picture of if you plan on taking selfies... good on Canon for that!\nThe camera uses \"zero ink\" paper, which doesn't print out amazing quality pictures, and in my experience, printed pictures tend to fade after some time.\nCompared to the polaroid zip or a lifeprint printer, the quality of photos are basically the same.  However, if I had to pick a winner in the novelty department in this case I would give it to Lifeprint.  The zip and lifeprint printers need to be connected to a phone app, but who doesn't carry their phone around with them anyway.  I was in the market for this kind of printer/camera because I like to use the printer to print pictures on small paper that can be stuck to an album and use this specifically for scrapbooking.\nAll in all, I wouldn't recommend this camera unless you had your heart set on taking pictures and having them print on the spot.  You'd find better results however, using your cellphone, picking (And editing if you wish) and printing using either the Lifeprint printer or the Polaroid Zip.", "It is so easy to take selfies with this instant print camera thanks to the mirror and they turn out looking good because of the auto flash.", "As the current fad of 'polaroid' style cameras goes, I'll admit that so far this one has the best picture quality of any I've seen. I still wish they'd figured out a way to put a flash on these darn things, though. I tested it in my kitchen, taking pictures of my pets, and the photos were very yellow-toned. It's definitely not my kitchen lighting, because I have taken plenty of photos in there that didn't have that coloring, though I suppose the camera could be picking up on the colors of the kitchen itself (greens and yellowish greens) or even the dogs (both of whom are blonde colored).\n\nOther than the off tones of the pictures, for the price of the photo paper ($25 for 50 sheets) I would have really hoped that there would be an option to choose whether or not to print a picture that you take. But nope, the moment you click that button, you've made that 50 cent decision.\n\nHowever, the size of this camera is great considering what it does, and the actual printed photos (which are wallet size - 2x3\") vs. a true polaroid style, are great. I would recommend this over other polaroid-style cameras that I've tried out the past year or two, for sure...IF you just really want a camera that prints automatically. Otherwise I'd say wait a bit and see if they perfect this technology a bit more.", "I got this for my 7 year old and she loves it. She has a couple friends who has cameras like this and wanted one so badly for herself.\nThe color of the camera is deep and beautiful.\nIt takes pics well. Just have to learn to hold it there for a second after you hit the button as it has like a delay flash. My 6 year old kept trying to use it and would move right away and get blurry pics.\nThey print quickly, look good amd my kid loves sticking them all over her room.\nLoading photo paper is easy, just wish that part was cheaper.", "I am a professional photographer who has owned multiple Canon DSLRs and point-and-shoots, and photo opportunities pop up in my head every day. In other words, I love photography and have been taking a lot of casual and professional photos. The old Polaroid instant cameras have a place deep in my heart.\n\nHISTORY BEHIND INSTANT CAMERAS\nOver the years, as digital cameras proliferated (especially with smartphones), prints had become less and less common. This had forced Polaroid, one of the pioneers of photo prints, and Kodak to exit the film (and in some cases, the camera) industry. More and more photos were casually taken and shared on social media, and the value of any one particular photo was no longer as strong as it used to be.\n\nPolaroid instant cameras (a device with a camera and built-in printer) were no more when they transitioned to a digital-only camera maker, but they have had such a cult following, instant photos were still popular among many. My wife still very much cherishes printed photos carefully laid out in photo albums, and I must agree -- flipping through them evokes a much more timeless, nostalgic feeling than scrolling through digital photos.\n\nIronically, instant photo printers have been making a comeback with Fujifilm Instax (the current leader by number of sales -- as much as over 8 million camera units sold in 2018), Polaroid, and Kodak, a trend set by influencers and social media enthusiasts. Canon decided to cash in on that trend with its IVY CLIQ cameras -- its first instant one -- although quite late to the party. Nonetheless, the company has a lot of experience making cameras. After all, they are the leader in the DSLR space, but in recent years, they have seemed to play catch up to their competition (looking at Sony and Nikon's successes up until just a year ago).\n\nThe IVY CLIQ (and its higher-end CLIQ+ sibling), unfortunately, do not live up to Canon's quality in terms of image quality or prints. That is sad, but at the price they are being sold at, one should not expect professional prints, but more as fun and simple cameras. The prints, however, are not as good as the old Polaroid instant cameras or the Fujifilm Instax.\n\nPROS\n- Fun and simple to use (there's no screen to flip through. Just point, shoot, and save or print)\n- Instant photo printing (takes about 50 secs)\n- Portable and compact\n- Wide 25.4mm lens is fast at f/2.2\n- 5 megapixel (MP) sensor (CLIQ+ has 8 MP)\n- Built-in flash\n- Selfie mirror (CLIQ+ version also includes an LED ring flash around the lens for taking better portraits by illuminating the face more softly and adding tasty catch lights to your eyes)\n- Prints provide a nostalgic, tangible feeling that digital photos lack nowadays\n- Can peel the print's adhesive backing, turning them into stickers (Peel-and-stick)\n- Optical viewfinder to frame photos with before taking the shot\n- Photos can be saved onto a microSD memory card\n- Auto exposure and auto focus\n- Standard microUSB cable charging\n- Reprint button to print another copy of the previous photo\n- Holds up to 10 sheets of Zink film paper. They are smudge-proof, tear-free, and water-resistant (don't dunk them into water though!)\n- 50-pack of Canon Zink paper costs $25, 20-pack is $10 ($0.5/print)\n- 2x2 and 2x3 layout printing options (number of frames per print)\n- 10 Zink sheets included (2x3)\n- No bulky instruction manual is included, minimizing trash and paper waste\n- Long battery life and charged quickly\n\nThe CLIQ does NOT have Bluetooth. As such, this model does NOT have the below functions that the CLIQ+ provides:\n- View on/share from your smartphone\n- Print any photo from your smartphone with the Canon Mini Print app. The same app can also print to Canon's stand-alone IVY printer\n- Use your smartphone as a remote control for group photos\n- Canon Mini Print app can be used to add filters, photo frames, and text to the photos before printing\n\nCONS\n- Printing speed can be considered slow at about 50 secs\n- Canon's Zink film does not print as well as Fujifilm's in regards to colors and resolution (the latter has several years of experience)\n- Photo quality taken by the CLIQ/CLIQ+ camera are not that great\n- Prints are mediocre, but turn out a bit better when the photo was originally taken with a smartphone\n- No bulky instruction manual is included. You have to download a copy from Canon's website\n- Camera will not take photos directly to the microSD card without any film in it. (For better photos, just use your smartphone anyway)\n\nTIPS and NOTES\n- CLIQ and CLIQ+ are known in Europe as the Zoemini C and S, respectively\n- Photos taken in good lighting will almost always come out better than ones taken in darker areas\n- Take photos with your smartphone (they are of better quality), then print to the CLIQ+ with the Canon Mini Print app for better print quality\n\nOverall, I am disappointed as a photographer who values quality. The images taken by the CLIQ/CLIQ+ cameras are mediocre, and the prints are a bit laughable. However, for instant, fun, simple prints, these are GREAT cameras to take with you on the road -- nothing beats taking silly photos with your family, print them, and instantly be able to use them as stickers or keep them for memories. Decades down the road, being able to hold this PRINTED photo of your family vacation... one that your children touched when they were young... will have a MUCH deeper connection than simply looking at the same photo on a screen.\n\nCanon's first array into the instant photo printer market is a nice try, but they have some catching up to do with Fujifilm.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please click the \"Yes/Helpful\" button below to encourage me to write more. Thank you!", "This Canon Instant Camera with Printer is SO fun to use! It is extremely compact and can fit into a pocket or small clutch. The yellow color is very bright and stylish. One of my favorite things about this camera is that it flashes bright lights as it prints the picture. My main reason for reducing 1 star is that the pictures do not come out nearly as bright as it shows they do in the product description. They have a cool vintage look, however, do not look like a picture you took with your phone at all. The paper is easy to load and the pictures print quite quickly. This is a super fun gift for anyone, especially pre-teens and teens, but is enjoyed by college kids and adults!", "This instant print camera is especially great for selfies thanks to the mirror that it comes with.", "I got this camera as a birthday gift and I am honestly so obsessed with it. It is so small and skinny so I can carry it around with me everywhere. It also takes solid pictures. I am pretty happy with the prints as well.", "I'm a huge fan of physical pictures, especially when you can get them seconds after pressing the shutter. The Canon IVY Cliq camera is using a technology called Zink and it stands for \"zero ink\".  There is no ink really storing inside the camera itself.  The camera itself is readily easy to operate.  You turn on the camera, you aim, then fire,  then it prints.  The package came with 10 Zink papers for you to try and you can get more from Amazon when you need it.  There is MicroSD card slot available to you, you could put a card in and it will store the image that you took to the card and you can view them on your computer.\n\nUnfortunately, I'm not bowled over by the image quality from Zink-based cars and printers.  The color and gradients of brightness are not that great.  The images have a very heavy mid-tone bias that makes them feel like something from the past, and not in a good way.\n\nIf you are looking for an easy way to share those selfies or group portraits in the real world, you should get the Canon IVY Cliq camera.", "I had the opportunity to try out this Canon CLIQ camera as part of the Amazon Vine program and it fulfills a function unseen since the days of Polaroids, but it feels very much like a \"work in progress.\"\n\nHere's the deal - it's a point and click camera that allows you to INSTANTLY PRINT OUT THE PHOTO YOU JUST TOOK!\n\nIs it a nice photo?\n\nWell, no. The resolution is reminiscent of photos taken with flip phones from 15 years ago.  Plus, your choice is either a photo two by three inches, or two by two inches (which is a 2 x 2 photo printed onto 2 x 3 paper.) Not exactly poster sized - or quality.\n\nThe camera charges with the ubiquitous Micro USB cord, and it's a good thing I already had some because the cord that came in the box connected well enough to turn on the amber \"charging\" light, but not nearly well enough to actually charge the camera overnight. I sent an email to Canon telling me the problem and they sent an email back telling me support for this product wasn't available by email and please call 1-800.... blahblahblah. Ain't nobody got time for that!\n\nI connected the camera to the USB that charges my kindle every night and by the next morning I had the reassuring green \"charged\" light lit. We loaded it with paper and took a picture. Out came the less than scintillating 2x3 photo. The camera is made of a flimsy plastic, by the way, and feels as if it would fly into a gazzillion pieces any time it were dropped onto anything harder than a pillow.\n\nThis is aimed at people who might think that a \"digital polaroid\" would be a cool thing so if your life is incomplete without low resolution 2x3 photos - your life just got better! For the rest of us.... meh.", "Old-fashioned shareable imaging takes on a new look in Canon\u2019s Instant Camera Printer. A viewfinder image is magically transformed onto a sticker \u00e0la Polaroid-style inkless technology, albeit in a smaller fashion through a digital camera form. There are challenges to this format that mirror users\u2019 experience with the Polaroid models, namely a difficult viewfinder aperture that complicates picture taking range and accuracy. The miniscule viewfinder on the Canon magnifies that problem. Imaging adjustments are only possible by retaking and printing the picture \u2013 you can\u2019t visualize the image prior to printing - a costly endeavor. An image viewing screen would have made this unique camera a more practical tool and less of a novelty. At this price point, for both camera and film, it\u2019s cheap thrills at a high cost.", "Canon has long established a good reputation in photographic equipment.  This camera is mediocre.  Another drawback was that no instruction booklet came with the camera.  The distinguishing feature is that this camera comes with a built in printer that prints very small images.  I can't say I was overly impressed.", "I love the color of this camera, yellow is my daughters favorite color and she was so excited to see the camera was yellow.  It is easy to use and the pictures come out great.  Instant pics are awesome and fun to use.  It is made well and works great.  easy to use.", "The photo paper that this camera needs is so cool as you don't need ink for it and the photos can also be stickers.", "I'm so happy that instant cameras are back. They never should have gone away. Now that nothing is on film anymore pictures are now being held hostage on our phones. I was immediately impressed by the size of the Canon Ivy. The size is reminiscent of cameras from back in the day. It's not bulky. It's easy to use. You can select between two different sizes for your photos (2x3 and 2x2). I took a couple of selfies and nature photos outside, in bright sunlight. None of the pictures came out great. I was really disappointed. The pictures had a grainy quality to them. Bummer. I was really hoping this would replace the my bulky Fuji Instax but it won't. The fuji instant camera may be bulky but it takes way better pictures.", "I didn't really know what to expect from this camera.  It is very thin and light.  It about the same width and height as a normal point and shoot digital camera. (just thinner)  It comes with 10 sheets of Zink (Zero Ink) paper and you can buy more for around 50 cents per sheet.  (2\" x 3\")  You open the door on the back and insert the stack of sheets with the blue alignment sheet face down.  (it tells you how to do this on the packaging for the paper)\n\nYou power the camera on, take a picture and wait.  The LED light blinks about 4 different colors while it is printing.  If you want another copy of that picture, there is another button to press to get more copies.  There is no preview so if you take a picture it is going to print.  The viewfinder has a 'frame' inside of it.  The camera will print whatever is inside of this 'frame' which took a few pictures to get used to.\n\nThe flash comes on sometimes and other times it does not.  The most difficult part for me has been to get the proper exposure.  My pictures come out either too dark or too light most of the time.  That is the biggest issue I have with the camera.  It is not as easy to take a good picture with as a normal point and shoot.\n\nIt is really cool though.  You hear it printing and then it slowly comes right out of the side of the camera!  That is by far the coolest feature. You can put an SD card in the camera to store your pictures as well.\n\nAlso, the Zink paper has a backing that you can peel and then stick.  I had a little trouble getting the backing to come off so if you don't want to use it as a sticker I don't think it will accidentally come off.  I have to use a pocket knife to get my pictures to peel. (just to start it)\n\nPros:\n-Cool factor.  A tiny printer inside of a camera.  Very cool technology.\n-Sticky backed paper.\n-SD card can be used to store images\n-You can print multiple copies if you get a good image\n-Thin and light\n\nCons:\n-Very difficult to get the proper exposure\n-No previews like standard digital cameras\n-2x3 pictures are pretty small\n-Fairly expensive paper for the picture size\n-Not a replacement for a point and shoot camera\n\nIt is obvious that this cannot replace a point and shoot camera.  That being said, it was never supposed to replace a point and shoot camera.  It is a very cool idea and it works ok.  It is amazing to watch it print though.  It reminds me a little of a Polaroid but the Polaroid pictures were probably twice the size of these pictures.\n\nIt is possible to have a lot of fun with this camera.  I gave it three stars because 50% of my pictures were overexposed or underexposed.  It is really not much of a serious camera.  My kid will use this at his birthday party though.  I bet the kids will get a kick out of taking pictures and sticking them to their shirts.", "The prince run about $0.50 each and they are far from perfect. But you will have so much fun with this camera it's totally worth the price.", "It is so simple to get a nice looking print when you use this camera. I love playing around with its functions, too.", "To cut to the chase, the Canon IVY ClIQ is a toy.  It is a large plastic fixed focus camera which is available in cheery colors.  It has an sd card slot and a printer, which uses ZINK 2x3\" film.  There is no shutter or exposure compensation (obviously) no focus, no depth of field.  It is not just an amateur camera, it is a kid's camera.\n\nWhat an unfortunate  way to be exposed to photography.  The colors are way off as is the exposure (well, there is no way to tell how the exposure is until you print, and no way to adjust or compensate).  The printer has a resolution of 314 x 500 ppi, which is about half the resolution of the worst ink jet printer in  our house (and we have some which are much better).\n\nMy daughter is a talented amateur photographer.  She has won some prestigious awards and is a pretty serious amateur.  I thought she would have fun with this, but instead, was pretty frustrated.  For one, the buttons aren't labeled (except for the one which allows you to choose 2x3 or 2x2 prints).  There were a couple of accidental photos, one of the lawn, another just a reprint.  This camera reminded me of how good we have it with a large window on the back of the camera (on most digital cameras) which allows us to to get a really good sense of what we are shooting, but, this is not about photography, it is about selling expensive film, which you will use a lot of if you can not tell how the photo has turned out.  I took several of her, outside (figuring we would have the best shot at getting good exposure, not knowing what iso it was intended to imitate).  I would guess 100-200.  We shot outdoors in the middle of the day, in Hawaii.  That should have been adequate light, and it seems to have been, but in one photo the flesh tones were white (clown white) in another they were red.  The low resolution of the printer ensures that you will never get a good photo.  The only thing which is \"good\" about it is that the film costs about half of what film for the Poleriod costs, but that is color rich film, and the camera has some controls, and the photos are twice the size.  I think this is meant to be a throw away festival camera.  I am surprised that Canon would put their name on it.  Canon makes some good cameras, and we have a photo printer from Canon which is quite good, and about the size of this camera, and it prints at much higher resolution, with more accurate colors, and costs about the same.  In fact, one of my favorite cameras is a little Panasonic Lumix with a Leica zoom lens, which cost about $15 less than this camera  I would say that there is no good reason to get this camera, except that, as my daughter pointed out, it prints stickers.... so maybe you would want to buy it for a 5 year old.  It probably fares better if dropped than the glass lens on my little Panasonic, but that one takes good pictures (and I have no doubt at all that one of the photo printing services would make them into stickers for you if that is what you want.... not instantly, but close).  Actually, if you want instant prints, buy almost any other camera, and the Canon compact photo printer.  It will get you beautiful photos instantly, at a fraction the price.\n\nThis is unquestionably the worst camera I have used since I ordered a miniature \"spy\" camera for $1 from an ad on the back of a comic book when I was a kid.  (That one was also about expensive film, and processing).", "This is a cute instant camera and it has some pros and cons. For the pros, I love the picture quality. The photos come out clear with really good color if you compare them to the Instax Mini by Poloroid. I think the quality of the photos is better. The camera itself is a little more simple than the Instax Mini-cuz they are cute! But the color print of the photo is pretty darn good in the Canon and it\u2019s sticker paper which is pretty neat and you have two size options for pictures on the Canon. I think for traveling, the Canon Cliq is smaller and easier to carry, tho I have a case for the Poloroid that is pretty sweet, the Canon fits into my purse with room to spare. Teens will love this as they do the small Poloroid.\n\nThe Canon Cliq produces really good quality photos with clear detail. For a fun instant camara-I like this. This is a colorful, fun little instant camera with no frills that produces fun, clear sticker pictures. What\u2019s not to like?\n\nAs usual, the cost of the 10 pack of film can be pricey so you have to try and not waste your film. But for fun get togethers, candid pictures you can print right away are very festive and fun.", "All pictures were dark even when pictures were taken outside", "This is a bright, lightweight camera that's basically a point and shoot and print. All you have to do is aim and push the button: The printing happens automatically. The camera comes with a pack of photo paper for 2\" x 3\" pictures, so you'll be able to try it out before investing in more film. When you do, it will run you about 50 cents per picture, which seems reasonable. (Especially if you remember how much we used to spend on film and processing in the pre-digital days.) The picture quality is okay for the purpose, and that purpose is, I'd say, impermanent fun: the photo paper is peel and stick, so these pictures are meant to adorn notebooks and lockers and mirrors, I'd say, not to be passed down to one's grandchildren. This picture will not replace your current point and shoot. It's just a fun party camera that may or may not be worth its price, depending on your priorities.\n\nOne problem with the camera is that it prints anything you take automatically, so if you accidentally press the shutter button you're getting a horrible picture printed out, whether you want it or not. The problem that bothers me more, though, is that it's very hard for me to see the frame in the viewfinder, the lines that demarcate what will print. Against certain backgrounds I can see some of them, usually not all of them. It's pretty annoying. Maybe if I had perfect vision it would help, or if I wore contacts, but with my glasses on or off I find that I'm just not able to frame a picture easily because of this problem. Your mileage may vary.", "The prints come out very resistant to smudges and tears and even water which I am very pleased with!", "This is such a cool little camera! I love being able to have hard copies of photos to print and share with my friends at events and to have as keepsakes vs scrolling through my phone to find them. The print quality is OUTSTANDING and the price is wonderful too. This is probably the best accessory to have this summer!", "This is a cute instant camera and I have had no issues or complaints with it. It's a novelty camera. It's not high end or high tech, but that's ok. For what it is, it works very well and does what it should.\n\nThe pics dont look bad in my opinion. It takes about 15 seconds after snapping a pic until you see it start to print out and then a few more seconds until it's done. Mine have turned out clear and reasonable quality for the camera. No distortions, no blurry or otherwise 'messed up' pictures.\n\nIt's fun to use and the pictures are nice physical memories instead of everything being online or in our phones.\n\nThe selfie mirror is just big enough to be able to see yourself and has printed out accurately based on what I see in it - meaning that what you see in the mirror is what prints.\n\nFilm loads easily. Theres a light that let's you know when battery is low, when film is loading, film is printing, or is jammed. It will light a different color or pattern per action.\n\nYou can change the aspect ratio by simply pressing a button, as well as reprint with just a press.\n\nCharges fast and you get a decent amount of prints per charge.\n\nIt's cute and fun. I like it.", "Like ease of use. Picture quality good but not great but realize just point and shoot camera. Fun to use.", "This is very easy to figure out and has a decent picture. Certainly not professional level, but good for vacations for the average photographers. Packs well in a suitcase or pocket. Simple and comfortable to hang onto. I like the sticky back paper. You can also scrapbook photos etc. The auto flash and photo duplication function works well. Pretty good smudge resistance. You can get a three year warranty through the company. Seems fairly durable.", "How much you like this camera will have to do with what you're comparing it to.\n\nCameras have come a long way over the years and we're use to the luxury of working with digital images that let you choose whether or not one is nice enough to print, and can use software to enhance photos to fix any flaws. So if you're comparing this one hundred dollar camera to the digital photos you can take with your one thousand dollar cell phone or DSLR camera, yeah you're not going to be pleased with the results.\n\nNow if you're looking for the nostalgia of instant print cameras like the original Polaroid, then this is actually a great option. I have two other newer instant print cameras, both made by Polaroid and the cost of the paper for those is crazy. Like so bad, had I realized the paper was that expensive (and they don't even give you any to start with when you buy the camera) I'd have never ordered them.\n\nThis Cannon however not only comes with paper, but the replacement paper is less expensive than the Polaroid options. Not that the Cannon paper is super cheap, but these types of cameras and their paper never have been inexpensive. Even 50 years ago when they more common, they were still expensive.\n\nFor an instant print camera, the pictures come out well. These aren't good low light cameras. The better the lighting (like outside on a sunny day) the better your photos will come out. And yes if you don't get the photo you want, you have just wasted a piece of the paper. That's how it always has been with these cameras. They never have been professional. They're all about just fun novelties.\n\nMy teenagers love this camera and my daughter buys replacement paper for it often. Teens these days have all kinds of digital photos on their computers, social media and their phone,  but not that many actually in hand. So my daughter loves the idea of taking a photo and it printing right away. She and her friends take the camera to dances and when they're out together, and get all kinds of fun photos together with it.", "This camera is a lot of fun! Sometimes you want to take pictures right away and share them with your friends. Of course, the quality is not going to be anywhere near the quality you can receive on a cell phone (not to mention a DSLR). I also don't love that the cartridges are pretty expensive on this film. It is high enough to where you get upset if you mess up a shot and waste the film.\n\nThe film is pretty easy to insert and remove. I didn't have any problem with getting the photos to work. It is a fun camera to play around with. I personally love capturing moments and would rather have them high quality and get the actual photos printed later. However, if you need low resolution photos immediately this is a great option. It is fun to use.", "Ok, first of all, let's get this out of the way. I'm a professional photographer...but don't worry, I'm not going to review the Cliq as a serious camera. I'm reviewing it as something for my wife (who prefers prints to digital images) to use, or for a kid to carry around.\n\nWe obtained the yellow Cliq, and honestly, it's adorable. Everybody who has seen it has said the same thing.\n\nOnce we charged it up, I took it outside to take some images of our neighbor's flower garden. One thing I noticed RIGHT AWAY is the shutter button is REALLY sensitive, and every time you hit the shutter, you get a print! In the first 15 minutes of use, I accidentally hit the shutter 3 times, and got 3 print outs of nonsense.\n\nThis brings up one of the worst things about this camera/printer: you get a print of EVERY image you take, at about $0.50 per print. Every image. You don't even get a chance to review the image before it prints out - you take the shot, then it starts printing....which leads me to another negative: the printer is agonizingly slow. I didn't time it, but it felt like it took 30 seconds, or more, to print out each shot, and while this is happening, your camera is a brick with a wrist strap.\n\nMy wife used the Ivy Cliq this past weekend, visiting her family out of state. She had thought our 14 year old niece might be interested in the camera, especially since yellow is her favorite color, and if this happened, she was planning on leaving it with her. Well...this didn't work out.\n\nShe gave the Cliq to her niece, and to her 10 year old nephew. After taking one of two images each, they quickly got bored with the delay between shots, and gave the camera back to her. Done. Period. Over.\n\nLet's talk about image quality. It's bad. Colors are VERY washed out, and biased to blue. They're also not terribly sharp, and another big negative, the fact that the viewfinder and the lens are separated by almost 2 inches makes it REALLY difficult to frame your shots, unless you're taking a selfie (more on selfies later). My wife commented that she got very frustrated when she tried to take images, only to find out she's missed her subject, or cut off a hand, part of a head, etc.\n\nFor selfies, the Ivy Cliq has a little mirror (reminds me of similar things some of the first cell phone cameras had) next to the lens to help you approximate getting yourself centered. Works ok.\n\nI provided her a 64GB micro SD card, and the Cliq saved each shot to this card, but she was so dissatisfied with the photos that she had no interest in saving the digital files, or printing them out on our home printer.\n\nShe did use the prints from the Cliq to make a Mother's Day card for her mom, taking images of herself, her sister, and all the grandkids who were there, and her mom was THRILLED with this. Of course, her mom still uses a flip phone that doesn't even have a camera.\n\nOh, I should mention, the prints have peel off sticky back. Nice feature.\n\nI honestly thought our niece would like the camera more than she did, figuring she'd like to take photos of her friends, and maybe stick them on her notebooks, inside her locker, etc., but that didn't happen.\n\nSo, we're gonna keep it around and see if we can figure out when or where to use it. Almost any cell phone camera will do a better job of taking photos. If you need instant prints, maybe the Cliq printer would be a better deal (I presume it accepts images from cell phones, and such), but even then, you're have to deal with the low quality of the Zinc printer technology, so YMMV,", "This is a horrible camera, even as a gimmick one, and that's all this is: a gimmick. The picture quality is just awful, and it automatically prints, no matter how bad the picture. The viewfinder is extremely poor and awkward, and the capture speed is slow. The picture quality is not good, though whether that's the camera or the printer is debatable. It's a great idea for pre-teens, but with the cost of paper refills, definitely not practical. You're better off just using a smartphone and a printer.", "Canon really missed the mark with this one. Here's a case of a company trying to be everything to everyone and failing miserably on this \"camera\". You would never find the name Nikon on something like this!\n\nIt takes borderline terrible pictures and while the novelty of printing out tiny stickers may appeal to some, it automatically prints every picture. I'm sure the technology to take the photo then prompt to print, save or discard isn't terribly complicated or cost prohibitive to have added.\n\nNow having said that, if this camera was $29.95, it would be a great toy for a 8 - 10 yr old to decorate their notebook, but at $100, it's too expensive for what it is. Add the .50 per print, and it really adds up.\n\nSo I would have to say pass on this unless Canon steps up their game and makes some serious improvements on ther next generation of this camera.", "Even though I recieved this product for free, this is my honest opinion and experience with this product.\n\nUsing this camera brings back so many memories. It feels like you are taking photos from the past. What a great experience.\n\nThis little camera is so fun to use. It is so simple, and I love how small the photos are. The build of the camera feels really retro, and modern at the same time. A really sleek design. It feels that \"high quality heavy\" it has some weight to it. But at the same time it is really light.\n\nThe photo quality is pretty good for the size. It does decent in low light, and is pretty accurate with colors. Though sometimes around the edges it does tend to have a more retro fading in color. It is not that noticable. But honestly I love the look.\n\nThe reason it doesnt have five stars.\nThe paper to refill the camera is very expensive. You already pay $100 for the camera itself. Yet you only recieve 10 photo sheets. So I can only take 10 photos. You also cannot pick which images to print. Point click and it automatically prints. So you cannot see if it is blurry or not. So it can be an expensive mistake. It can also be a bit slow on the shutter speed.\n\nFor the price I hoped it would have many more sheets for photos. Or more options for printing. Even a screen to see a little more before you shoot.", "I like this camera. It is easy to load and it is easy to use.  Everything about this camera is nice.  It doesnt go much further.\n\nThis is at its base a point and shoot camera.  It's much like the old instamatic were one would look through the viewfinder and shoot.  You would then hope for a proximity of what you wanted.  I have been able to get some decent pictures, they just havent been great.\n\nOne of my issues is the actual taking of the picture.  You take a picture and the picture prints.  You get a pretty nice picture which is also a sticker.  If you are not careful you might get two pictures or you might take another.  The camera is very sensitive.  Film comes in at about 50 cents a picture so one does need to be careful.  It isnt super expensive but it is enough to make you careful.\n\nThis is an ok camera built by Canon.  The body is tough and picture quality is decent.  This is a tough call between a 3 and a 4.  I gave it a 4 because I gave a blast taking the pictures.", "I thought I would get more use out of taking small, thumbnail-sized photos but that just didn't happen.  For one, the cost of the film paper is prohibitive, especially considering how tiny the picture ends up.  For another, I see this as something that you would use for a business for a specific purpose, and not as a private consumer.  Even though the stickers were fun, once I factored in the cost of each, it took the joy right out of it.", "This is a novelty just like all polaroids throughout history have been.  My kids lived playing with this, but the replcement film is a bit too expensive for their taste.  Quality is fair.  But they have phones that take pics, so they lost interest in this real quick.", "So, to start, the instructions included a few words, but the primary directions are pictures. That\u2019s ok. I figured out that the camera needed to be charged using the enclosed usb charging cord. Charging took less than an hour \u2014 the light changes from red to green when it\u2019s fully charged. I followed the diagram and pictures to figure out which parts function in which way, and read a few reviews that said the shutter was really sensitive. Following the very unclear pictured instructions, I loaded up the paper, closed the back of the camera, and shot a photo. Or so I thought. The camera made some rumbling noises and then the top of the camera started flashing red \u2014 it\u2019s supposed to flash different colors as it\u2019s printing the photo. So, I charged it again just to be sure, checked the insagain, and reloaded the paper. Took another photo. The paper came out blank. Ok. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Give up. Nonsense.", "The Canon Ivy Cliq camera is great for everyone, it\u2019s easy enough for my 10 year old to use but still prints good quality photos for any adults who want these cute little 2x3 sticker photos.\nThe lighting can sometimes be an issue so I would recommend using in well lit areas.\nGreat quality photo paper, we stuck one on the back of the iPad and we haven\u2019t had any problems with it coming up after 4 days of moderate use.\nButton on the camera allows the last photo to be reprinted (which is great for friends) or you can insert a micro sd card and transfer photos to your computer.", "I didn't realize how small the pictures would be (2x3). In comparison the old (and newest) Polaroid cameras take 4.25x3.5 pictures. It's still usable, but it makes it seem even more like a toy. We got two of these camera and some of the pictures are better than others. Some of the pictures have imperfections. There are sometimes a line or two per print where it looks like it didn't didn't print for a line. The kids found it fun, but I'm not sure we'll even buy more film.", "As others have mentioned the picture quality is not that of a newer iPhone. However, I wouldn\u2019t expect that from an instant camera. I trust the canon brand and this seemed to be a pretty good product. I took one picture tonight to test it out and I thought it turned out beautifully. It was super easy to figure out the buttons and where to put everything. (If worried about accidental picture prints I would suggest not putting all the film in at once just in case.) There\u2019s also a wrist strap you can attach which makes it easy to carry it around. I\u2019m excited to take more pictures tomorrow!", "This cute little camera/printer was fun to try out. The setup and installation of the printer paper was easy, the pictures it takes are clear and watching them come out is fun. As a person who remembers the old Polaroid instant picture cameras and the cumbersome paper and the chemical application required to preserve the photos, this little camera/printer from Canon is a revelation and shows how far this technology has come.  The ability to send photos to it via Bluetooth is a stroke of brilliance. There is something about a printed picture that surpasses sending from one phone to another that is fun and friendly. I only found one issue with this device. The power button and the shutter are a hair\u2019s breadth apart, and it only came with 10 printer pages. After one successful photo, I accidently used two more in trying to shut the camera off. Since the paper is pretty costly, this is an indicator that one could waste a lot of expensive paper if one is not very careful. I really think the proximity of the two buttons is faulty engineering. However, it will certainly sell a lot of printer paper for the device. If gifting this camera/printer, please include a couple of packs of paper for it. It will make it a lot more fun for the recipient!", "We bought this for my daughter's birthday in June.  She used it a couple of times in June and July but upon trying to use it during our recent vacation, discovered it no longer works.  It has not been damaged but simply stopped working.  It is, ofcourse, after the 30 day Amazon return window.", "This camera is fun. It's great for instant selfies. Easy to use you just hold it and shoot, what you see in the mirror is what you get in the picture. They become stickers if you want. You can put them on your trapper keeper, or the back of your computer, your fridge or your grandma's fridge. The picture quality is great! Very clear. Hard to believe for those of us who grew up in the 1980s when the only instand cameras gave poor quality no matter how much you shook the picture. Just fun.", "The Canon Ivy Cliq is a simple, easy to use instant print camera that is also able to save to a microSD memory card. The caveat here is that the camera will not work without it having photo paper inside - it is primarily an instant photo camera that happens to save images digitally as well. This means it will print the photo once the shutter is released - no option to cancel the print. Styling of the camera is attractive and minimal - although the \u201cLadybug Red\u201d is closer to a Reddish Pink. There is a selfie mirror on the front of the camera.\n\nThe camera has no displays, but it is intuitive enough. There is an optical viewfinder, and lights show the status of the camera. There is a light on top that glows when the camera is ready to take a picture, and color cycles when it is processing the image. Buttons on the camera are minimal - image size (rectangular 2x3 or Square 2x2), power, reprint and shutter. The camera plays a tone when it\u2019s powered on. The status light can be hard to see in bright outdoors sunlight.\n\nThe camera works best outdoors during the day. Under these conditions, images are colorful. Under less ideal conditions, colors can become muddy, and indoor shots need to be well-lit for the camera to capture something approaching a useable image. The built in flash is somewhat useful, but won\u2019t replace a well-lit scene.\n\nThe camera lens is fixed focus, and is a bit wide - which makes it forgiving when framing up a shot. There is a small delay during shutter release, and the print emerges from the camera after about 50 seconds, fully developed. The camera uses Zink photo print technology. There is no need to shield the print from light when it emerges from the camera.\n\nThis not a camera for hard-core photographers. It is meant to be a fun, spontaneous camera that will take and print photos with minimal fuss. It really works best outdoors where there is a lot of light. Prints average 50 cents apiece, so some thought needs to be taken with each photo, but that is part of why instant photo cameras are special. Overall it\u2019s a fun, easy to use camera.", "The photos that get printed can also be used as stickers which makes it so fun to hang up these photos! I've made quite a few cute collages.", "I got this little instant print camera a couple of weeks ago and it is now something that I take with me everywhere. It is the perfect size for carrying around and for taking photos. It also works so well and produces great photos. I could not be happier.", "Fun little camera for not so serious shots.  My teen loves it.", "I love being able to print out photos whenever I am on the go as it makes the prints all the more special.", "I love the concept of this camera - it's very cute and makes for a great little BFF bonding activity. However, the pictures are not that great and it can get kind of expensive buying the paper. At least with the FujiFilm instant cameras you get a better picture - obviously nothing is going to beat a real camera or a phone, but I just wasn't that impressed. Additionally, it feels like a kid's toy over an actual camera. Cute concept and cute design, but execution was a bit off.", "Because I am a professional photographer, my view of the Canon IVY CLIQ+ Instant Camera Printer Mobile Mini Printer Via Bluetooth may be harsh. However, to me this camera is more reminiscent of a toy camera than the old time Polaroid instant photo cameras that it is supposed to emulate.\n\nCanon makes some superb point-and-shoot cameras. I own two of them\u2014the aged but still very functional Powershot S-90 and the newer and most impressive Powershot G7x Mark II. While I didn\u2019t expect the Canon IVY CLIQ+ to match a camera costing more than four times its cost, I did expect decent photos. I also expected decent instructions\u2014although Canon only included a sketch instruction sheet.\n\nWhat you do get is a camera with a tiny built-in printer that uses special Ivy ZINK paper that produces, at its largest, a 2x3 print. After using up the included five sheets, this paper will set you back 50 cents per sheet. The image quality is not very good. Sure, for a selfie it\u2019s fine, but for anything else you will be better off to grab your smartphone. (I never thought that I\u2019d find myself recommending that in a review!!!)\n\nThere are two models. The Canon IVY CLIQ and the Canon IVY CLIQ+.  The Canon IVY CLIQ+ has built-in WI-Fi and can commute with a smartphone using the Canon Mini Print app. The app is nothing to write home about. Yes it can see your photo library and it can remote control the camera to a point but you can\u2019t see what you are taking before hand and there is only minimal control over the camera.\n\nBoth version support a micro SD card. I inserted one but was unable to tell whether the Canon IVY CLIQ+ was accessing it. Furthermore, I had hoped that, without paper, the Canon IVY CLIQ+ would use the card instead. No such luck. The camera refused to work without paper installed inside.\n\nCanon makes some great cameras. The Canon IVY CLIQ+ and the  Canon IVY CLIQ are not among them.", "The idea of being able to print right from your camera is clever, but I have to think that we're too early on the curve to get the best benefit/value from this type of device. This is not one to be an early adapter on, I think. The cost is high, the quality is low. Give it a couple of years and we'll probably see lots of competition and innovation to improve on this idea - because it *is* a good one.", "So far I am loving this camera except the capture button is very touchy it will print right through the papers if you\u2019re not careful. Wish it had an option to print or cancel. The papers are are not cheap. It comes with 10 of the picture paper to start. Light weight easy to use and you can put in a memory card.", "Although I think I'm being a bit generous with my star rating, I'll stick by it because: IF you knw what you're getting and IF it's what you want, this does do the job well... ish\n\nBasically, this is an updated version of the old Polaroid Land camera of the old days.\n\nIt is EXTREMELY easy to use and it gives you mini-pix in just a few seconds, that you can share with friends, stick on book covers, whatever (to be clear, I mean actual hard-copy pictures 2'x3' or 2\"x2\")\n\nBUT: The pictures are NOT cheap; running about .50 per copy (24.95 for a pack of 50 sheets) However, there IS a slot for a microSD chip for greater flexibility. The pics are of decent quality, but nowhere near what even a mid-line camera or, smartphone can do. The controls are simple enough, but they blend in with the body in such a way as to cause you... alright me... to inadvertently snap without meaning to (did I mention the .50 a pic?)\n\nIn short, I think you'll get limited use out of this, but what use you get will be fun!", "This Canon Ivy CLIQ Instant Camera is like an updated version of a Polaroid! It was a lot of fun to use.\n\nI would say this is more for entertainment instead of serious photography. The photos do not come out as crisp and clear as they show on the product page. I understood this was probably the case before I used it so I wasn\u2019t disappointed. Plus, for the price how good could they come out. I would say this is great for like a party or even for kids.\n\nRefills are very inexpensive so make sure to buy the camera with atleast one pack. Only ten prints are included in the camera. I do like that you can add a memory card so you can upload your images quickly and easily. The face recognition does well as long as there\u2019s good lighting.\n\nOverall, I\u2019m happy. It is a fun little camera. Would be great for office parties, house parties, anything like that. Reminds me of a portable photo booth. Definitely recommend!!!", "I really love this blue instant camera. It is so slim, so it is easy to carry around and I am very impressed with its picture taking capabilities, too!", "This camera is great for kids but the supplies are kind of expensive.  It should have come with some kind of internal storage so that not every picture had to be printed.  Also lack of a screen makes it hard to see what you have.  Kids like it though because they like stickers.", "This camera is so skinny, you would never have expected it to be able to print out such nice looking photos! As a result, it makes it really easy to travel with this camera. I also really like the color of it. I would definitely recommend it to others!", "Didn\u2019t care for this camera at all. I should have purchased the one with Bluetooth and edit capability. I do not recommend at all", "As long as your expectations are in line with what this product actually is, you will be really happy with it and have a good time using it.\n\nI bring this out when my family is going to gather and I want my kids and relatives to participate in having fun recording the event in photos. It's really fun that if we get a special one, we can click the reprint button and have it print a second one, and it's easy enough to use that with a few reminders about how we do have to pay for these pictures and so make sure you're getting a shot that you want, my six-year-old can also participate in recording our family events and bond with family members over pictures. The fact that they are stickers adds an extra layer of charm.\n\nWe have good cameras and cell phone cameras and this one fits a niche completely different. Its about the immediacy of the moment and the sharing of special moments with family. The picture quality is perfect for the small size of pictures it creates, but it is not meant to be a high-end camera, it's much more like the old-school Polaroids, which I think all of us probably have a few precious ones in a memory box.\n\nI really appreciate the simplicity of this and how grand parents and children alike can learn to use it and how much fun it is at a party.", "I am obsessed with this ladybug red instant print camera. It looks absolutely amazing and it works like a charm.", "The paper that you feed this instant print camera is amazing as it does not require any toner or ink to get the job done.", "The Good:\n-Compact design\n-Decent picture quality for basically a point and shoot\n-Fun instantaneous gratification\n-Easy set up\n-Prints quickly\n-Can save photos to micro SD card\n\nThe Bad:\n-Zink paper is expensive\n\nThe Bottom Line:\nThis is a pretty fun camera to have around if you like instant printing gratification. I used this while some friends were visiting and it was fun to take some snapshots of their kids and give them the pictures. I think adults were like that\u2019s kind of cool but the kids were ecstatic. The Zink paper also allows you to peel and stick so that was a huge hit. The camera takes a a decent image (5 megapixel) and the printing is fast. The big downside is Zink paper is expensive so you don\u2019t want to waste pictures. Overall, I wouldn\u2019t say you need this camera but if you want something fun and you want to print small photos for people on the spot, this is a great little camera.\n\n*If you found my review helpful, please let Amazon know by clicking the helpful button below!\n\n**Disclosure: I received a sample product from the Amazon Vine program for an honest and unbiased review.", "Not .", "I like how the photos are also stickers that way I can hang them up on my walls to use them as decorations.

The paper is inserted and it prints after a photo is taken.  The light changes color to let you know it's printing.

I just wanted a gift she would actually USE and LOVE for more then 5 min! FINALLY! This did it! She was so excited! Genuinely excited! Happy! Over the moon! She went on and on about the greatest Instagrahmers and Youtubers all have Polaroids. She absolutely loves how small and sleek it is. It fits perfectly in her cute, posh, fringe purse. She loves that she can just connect it to her smart phone!! We live in a world of \"filters\". You can't edit or filter a instant camera BUT you can with your smart phone then print it with this baby!! It also gives you the option of taking a photo and instantly printing instead of choosing that perfect picture from your phone. Oh I should mention that you need an app!

With that said, I can explain to you why this product is what you want vs these small vintage-era portable film cameras offer. I bought this as a mother's day incentive so that whenever a holiday comes around, i can print a photo off and give it to them as a friendly gesture.\n\n1. The quality of the photo taken from your phone, is transported onto this device. Meaning, instead of risking wasting film on trial and error, unsure of what you'll get --- you simply take a photo of anything with your camera, and you can print it off. Easy as that. The better (phone) camera, the better end product.\n\n2. Customization. With the onboard software, which I've reviewed and was thanked by the HPSprocket Team, allows you to edit, critique, or just make a photo something entirely new.\n\n3. Personal Achievements: Sometimes we get rewards from our phone, via a email, video game, or just a simple notification. Instead of screenshotting that and sending it to your friend, asking for the same, equal excitement --- you can print that screenshot off, put it in a photo album, and allow yourself to make a bookmark of achievements. The photos I've provided will show you some of the things I've achieved in this year alone and how this device helps with my accomplishments.\n\n4. Stickers. You can apply stickers to virtually any photo you upload onto your sprocket; even as far as taking photos and turning real life animations/stickers/logos and making you're very OWN stickers to apply to your OWN photos! I hope that makes sense; its easier shown than read. You'll get it once you play with the software\n\n4. Up to date software. This is important among all hardware and film. If the software doesn't work, the hardware and YOU, don't either. Updated frequently, with the ability to upload your own photos in case you need that storage on your phone.\n\n5. Film. inexpensive, slightly small, and wallet sized. Depending on the model device you get, this effects the film length/price. I got this model for the cost of film is independent from buying the device.\n\nCons:\nThe color in the photos isn't always the best, and the device needs to be plugged into something for more than 2-4 photos. but the ability to do some of these things with film is extraordinary in the first place; whats the saying? Don't look a gift horse in the mouth?\n\nWith all these these pros, and slight cons, I would suggest this over film any time. You get to practice using digital film, (your phone or what have you.)  the film is inexpensive, and the virtual customization is in any shape, way, possible.\nSuperb choice for those interested in editing photos.\nThe photos above are things I've done with mine. :)", "It works great, connects great, picture quality is what i expected. However, every picture I printed, it would print a red line right through the middle of the photo.  At first, I didn't notice it, then after 3 or 4 photos, i could clearly see the red line.  I thought maybe it was just something that happened that one time, so i printed a few more, and sure enough the red line continued to show and continued to become more and more noticeable.

I do a lot of work from home and wanted to be able to have a good camera for Zoom calls with a small group around my conference table. I learned about the Meeting Owl from being on the receiving end of a call with several people around a table. The sound quality was great and I was quite impressed with the device's ability to focus the camera on the person speaking, coupled with the full \"panorama\" view of the room from the middle of the table. I called the host of that meeting to learn what they were using and discovered the Owl. I was about to buy a more traditional camera / audio system but I liked the functionality of the Owl. The bonus is that it cost a bit less than what was I considering. Net net, I'm very happy with the device. It works great, picture and sound quality are excellent, and it connects easily to my MBP. I've been using it on and off for about a month and so far, I have not found any gotchas.", "My company got a beta unit a couple months ago.  I'm normally the one in the conference room with our remote employee who calling in.  He tells me it really helps.

It works very well, showing a close-up video of all the participants of a meeting, the general view of the the meeting room, and switching to show the person currently speaking.

But in application it is not as sharp or as quick as I would have liked.  The 720p camera is not as nice as I hoped it would be.  Plus the system lags a bit when changing from speaker to speaker or when attempting to capture two speakers at once.  So now I have purchased the Meeting Owl Pro.  It is 1080p which I hope will much improve the video performance and I hope the response time for following from speaker to speaker is improved as well.  I will leave a review when I have some experience with the \"Pro\" version.  Having said all that, this version of the Meeting Owl may be quite adequate for less fussy individuals.  You can get it and try it out for 30 days.  Amazon was very helpful when I returned this one to get the new one - no problem.", "This is a great tool for meetings.

The tracking is impressive, the camera quality is 720p (that's why it received 4 stars on picture quality, it could be better but it is still impressive).  The sound is perfect and we are using this in a conference room that is about twice as big as is recommended by the manufacturer.  I highly recommend this.\n\nJust as a FYI we use this with ZOOM and they integrate together with no problems.", "Our remote employees absolutely love the owl. We started with one for our main conference room and they insisted we get one for each of our other conference rooms.", "Highly recommend this unit. We use it with Zoom meetings, and it has performed flawlessly so far. It quickly tracks the speaker, and the sound quality is the best we've ever used.

Great innovativion and concept. Lots of opportunities from the speakers perspective. Quality audio is poor; and volume is too low.", "Owl is really great and has made a big diff in our meetings.  Audio is better than a speaker phone (both mic and output) or tv, and the views rock - in many ways because the camera is simultaneously closer to everyone and also the distance to participants is more evened out.  So you can both see everyone, and make out everyone's face.  And the simplicity is *great* (just plug in and it works, no software to install, extra mics, wires, etc).\n\nSmall asks:\n- It would be nice if the resolved video was slightly higher res so you could read things on whiteboards (without writing super huge)\n- It does seem to pickup HVAC/computer fans just a bit... don't know if there's a way to filter out drone type noises better.\n- Super minor - An indicator on the unit of which way is front (ie, which side is where the split in the panorama view is) so you can split the in-room tv instead of someone's head.", "Good product. People who work remotely for our company really appreciate the expanded views of everyone in the room.\n\nThe sound quality and mic are good. However I feel the video quality could be improved a bit. It\u2019s perfectly usable, but not quite as good as say a mid grade Logitech webcam. Feels a little mushy and slightly underexposed.\n\nGenerally people like it and we\u2019re considering a second one for another conference room.", "Looks super cool. Works as advertised.\nEasy interface... just plug it in via USB and the owl takes care of making all the people show up.\nSound quality is better than our previous VOIP Polycon conference phone.\nOnly recommendations:\n1) it doesn't always key in on who is speaking.  I haven't called support, so they might have a setting or something I need to tweak.\n2) we have a glass wall on one side of the conference room and lots of backlight comes in on that side that degrades the video quality a bit.\n3) our table holds 10 people.  sometimes the Owl has a long way to see folks at the far end of the table and they appear pretty small.\n4) sometimes, where to look if you are in the conf room is awkward.  you want to look the person you are speaking to in the eyes, but that means you have to look at the screen where you are projecting the online participants video feeds.  That is not next to the owl if your owl is in the middle of the table.. so you aren't looking at them when they are looking at you, which makes the non-verbal communication piece still not completely solved.\nI would imagine in a smaller room with a 6 top round table, and no external light coming it, it would be better, but still not sure where to put the screen..", "We bought the Meeting Owl to record meetings, so that those not in attendance can get a different viewpoint than a traditional camera in front of the room. It works well moving around to capture the person that is talking. If someone has a quieter voice, then it has more trouble locating that person than someone who naturally projects their voice or has a deeper voice. The top section of panoramic view is very nice when reviewing recorded video, but it would be a great feature if you could make that top section take up more of the overall viewing screen. For example, the ability to make the panoramic picture take up 40% of the screen instead of a bar across the top. The algorithm for finding voices/people could be improved. You will see sometimes the Owl is \"watching\" nobody, or somebody who stopped speaking two minutes ago.\n  Set up is very easy, two cords two plugs. A neanderthal, if given the correct training, could certainly work the Owl. In fact, the idea that HomoNeanderthalensis was significantly less intelligent than early HomoSapiens may be more myth than reality. Their brain sizes, as indicated by cranium cavity size was slightly smaller, yes, but you can not infer function from size. Case in point; some early Homo species had very large brains, yet we can infer from their evolutionary proximity to aboreal primates and lack of evidence they used tools that they were not particularly intelligent. The human brain as developed a lot over a great period of time. Our brains now contain a vastly more complex structures and compressed amount of neurons than our ancestor's brains did hundreds of thousands of years ago. If you were going to make the argument that brain size alone correlates with intelligence, then you must hold the belief that men are on average more intelligent than females. This is because men often have a physically larger brain. I doubt that someone would hold that belief, however, and it further shows that size does not give any inference about function.\n  Whats more, paleo-archaeological evidence shows that Neanderthals likely lived in complex social units. There have been discoveries that indicate older Neanderthals, possibly in their 60's would have been disabled from injuries suffered, but continued to live on for what is presumed to be decades. This is shown by the healing of broken bones, after all, a broken bone will heal itself if given time and nutrition. So, yes, while the Owl is simple to use let us not disparage our long lost Neanderthal brethren.\n  Overall, we've been happy with our Owl. I would recommend reaching out to OwlLabs with questions or concerns. They appear to be good company, that is to say, a company that is dedicated to serving their customers. It is a novel idea that is useful in a wide variety of applications. Some sort of carrying case/book-bag that protects the device would be a great accessory.  I cannot speak for their take on Neanderthal brain anatomy, or how they feel in general concerning the Neanderthal subspecies.", "Wonderful device .. I use it for my personal customer on-site meetings as we want to get everyone on the call .. I love the experience and how it very well integrates with zoom ..\n\nOnly Con I would say are\n\nSometimes the individual recognition is not very accurate .. and if you\u2019re using it in a conference room with a tv for screen share and audio output (as the speaker in MO might not be loud enough) the individual AI video being generated freaks out and does a never ending split as it thinks there are multiple people that it needs to split as the audio feedback loops in\n\nIf the price is at 500 I would say it\u2019s the best value for money", "Not being able to use this solution with Adobe Connect which wasn't emphasized in the marketing, rendered it useless to our organization.  That said, really liked the approach  and promises of the solution which is very innovative and hope to reevaluate if they support Adobe in the future.", "The Meeting Owl is not your typical video conferencing bird.  This camera/speakerphone combination has a 360\u00b0 camera (no moving parts) and microphone array, allowing the remote participants in the video conferencing meeting to see and hear the entire room. The loudspeaker has a nice tone quality and can get adequately loud for a medium-sized room.\n\nThe Meeting Owl is covered in a nice dark grey fabric rather than a metal grill. Unfortunately, the velcro wraps that I use to manage the cables frequently attach themselves to the fabric. Over time, it\u2019s fuzzing-up the fabric. Plus, the fabric will collect hand oils when the unit is moved around. If you won\u2019t need to move the Owl from room to room, this will be a minimal annoyance.\n\nThe 360\u00b0 panoramic view across the top of the video gives the remote participants a great overview of the room and who is in the meeting. One co-worker calls it \u201cThe Last Supper\u201d view. The remote participants will be aware of everyone in the room. They won\u2019t experience a disembodied voice suddenly coming from off-camera or be surprised to discover that a particular person is attending the meeting but just sitting out of view. This may be a problem for the in-room folk that hate \u201cbeing on camera\u201d - they\u2019ll have to hide under the table.\n\nThe 360\u00b0 camera allows you more flexibility in how you configure your huddle/conference room. You are not limited to a narrow and deep configuration to fit everyone in the field of view of a traditional camera. A round or square table, or even a wide room can work.\n\nThe Owl is tall enough for its camera to just clear a 15.5\u201d screen laptop that\u2019s placed close to it. However, you may need to elevate the placement of the Owl if you have standing meetings with tall people in a small room.\n\nThe \u201cSpeaker Spotlight\u201d view in the main portion of the video window is where the magic happens - automatically \u2018spotlighting\u2019 the person that is talking, up to the three most recent people. This is super handy; the meeting can \u2018just happen\u2019 - no one needs to be responsible to reposition a webcam, or control a PTZ (pan/tilt/zoom) camera to point it at the person currently talking. The free app does allow you to manually override the spotlight as desired.\n\nTip: The Owl doesn\u2019t have an indicator on the unit to show where the panoramic view splits (the far left and right ends). So I put a sticker near the top of the Owl and tell folk to orient the sticker toward the video display to give the best panorama - placing the person opposite the display from the Owl in the center of the panoramic view.\n\nThe video quality is 720p, adequate for typical video conferencing meetings. The video is somewhat \u2018soft\u2019, not sharp, crisp images of some higher end webcams. Most of the time people are either sharing presentation slides or having discussions, not focusing on someone\u2019s skin blemishes, so this may not be a big deal. Plus, many video conferencing systems don\u2019t transmit anything higher than HD and not everyone has the bandwidth to handle much above that either. However, the video \u2018softness\u2019 could be an issue if you regularly have someone writing on a whiteboard in the room. They will need to write bigger and use stronger contrasting colors to combat reflective glare from ceiling lights. Hopefully a future firmware update will improve this particular situation.\n\nFor people accustomed to talking towards a speakerphone, they will naturally face the Owl giving the remote participants a full view of their face. However, many people will naturally turn to the display screen when talking to the remote participants. Depending on where they are sitting in relation to the Owl, the remote participants will end up seeing the person\u2019s profile, or even most of the back of their head! In these situations, either the in-room person or the remote participants may miss nonverbal signals and reactions. Pre-planning where people sit, the placement of the Owl, or even mirroring/multiple displays will help reduce these situations.\n\nThe Meeting Owl can be a great benefit in group discussion meetings. The in-room participants will look at and talk to the other in-room participants. The remote participants will be able to see more facial and physical expressions of the in-room participants, helping them to feel more involved in the discussion rather than disconnected observers.\n\nThe Meeting Owl\u2019s innovative camera and ease of use make it a great option for huddle rooms up to medium-sized rooms depending on room configuration. It can be placed closer towards the person sitting at the far end of the table, and no \u2018camera operator\u2019 is needed. It's a great option to have in my video conferencing toolbox.", "Incredibly easy to set up and use, the Meeting Owl has made a huge difference for our remote workers. During our weekly staff meetings, all of us can now be on camera when we speak and it makes our remote workers feel like they are more a part of the group. The sound is WAY better than our previous webcam and the multiple cameras and speaker focus makes the experience much more inviting. The video is still a little grainy, but I blame that more on our poor lighting than anything else. The Meeting Owl is definitely worth the cost.", "I bought an early model and the Meeting Owl has been great, it does elicit a reaction of either love or fear in some people when they see it but once they are remote in a meeting with one, normal cameras are a letdown. It's hard to describe how much better a dynamic meeting video can be using the owl, it's as if you have a multiple camera tv-studio in your conference room. The audio is clear both from the speakers and the mics for the remote person. Love it and we bought more.", "The owl is awesome.\nI ordered it from the US to Europe because it\u2019s not yet available in Europe.\nThere is no other solution that is that simple and useful.\nAfter the first one I ordere another one for our 2nd meeting room. Very cool.\nEveryone who joins our meetings is amazed now by the visibility it provides.", "The Owl is amazing and really makes connecting with remote teams seamless. The AI around automatically moving the camera to whoever is speaking is truly cutting edge and it ultimately the differentiation against other corporate meeting cameras. Super easy and simple to set up and does not connect to your company's internet directly, but rather through your computer, so any issues around data security/privacy is solved as your already encrypted computer provides all the broadband needed to use the Owl. 100% would recommend to anyone working with colleagues in remote locations.", "This is my second one - first one is in such demand, we needed another.\n\nThese are great for meeting in smaller rooms for upto 12 or so people. It actually holds up better than expected in larger conference rooms, but sound and picture quality degrade. It's all about the placement of people around the OWL and their proximity to the OWL. The larger the room, the further people will be spaced from the OWL, so naturally you'd have diminishing returns. I think optimally people should be maybe 8-10ft max from the OWL.\n\nI love that this is a self contained unit that does all the thinking - no special drivers needed. So far it has been truly plug and play. Plug it in and not only does the system automatically recognize it, but Zoom will usually select it automatically as the default for cam/mic/speaker. We've only had to enter into the system settings once or twice to force it to recognized and used as the default.\n\nFolks at the remote end love that this tracks the speaker. They can see who is talking as well a panorama of the entire group - at the same time.\n\nCONS:\nCost: at $800 it was not an easy decision to make the first time around. After working with one for a while I am sold on how well it works, but still steep at $800.\n\nMics: Not really a CON but more of a wish-list item. For larger rooms it is the speaker and mics that degrade faster than the cam. It would be great if this could work with external mics and speakers. I could then set up my wireless conference mics/speakers around the room and let the OWL handle the cam. The cam still holds up pretty well in larger spaces - better than the single POV cams. Folks really like being able to see everyone in the room with the inside-the-circle 360 view. However, as it is the OWL is dependent on the internal mics to track the direction of the current speaker. I haven't actually tested external mics/speakers with the OWL, but I suspect that it would work just fine, but just not be able to track the speaker. Worst case scenario might be that the CAM would bounce around trying to figure out who to focus on. I'll get a chance to test this out at some point.\n\nItem Reviewed: Meeting Owl 360 Degree Video Conference Camera", "My boss loves it. looks cute at office. it could be great if owl can move a bit more and make sound more.

The picture quality isn't super Hi-Def but good enough for what its needed for, that could also be the median we are using for conferencing. The one drawback may be having to plug it directly into a computer which is on a wall behind an 80-inch screen, about 10 feet away. I currently have a USB extender running it back to the computer, I suggest if you do this you get one that includes AC power adapter otherwise the signal will not come through as it should.

I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll improve in its next iteration, but considering this is the first version the company has made, they had made a great initial product.

Once they come out with a 4k version I'll give it another shot, but for now, we're sending it back.\n\nAlso, having to use an iPhone app to set it up is strange, since their target customers are businesses. How many businesses want their employees using their personal iPhone to set up a conference room cam?", "Video quality could be better but the experience its superb.\nIt focuses speakers each time without failing and audio quality is clear.\nGreat for remote working.", "Works perfect", "I really like how easy this is to use.  It's virtually plug and play.  Works well with everything we tried (skype, zoom, goto).  The sound is good, the picture is good and it's great for a small-ish room.  It's also ridiculously easy to move from one room to another should you need to do that.\n\nMy only wish is that they would make a version of it with expansion microphones.  Some of our more...err... image conscious users wish for a stand so that the camera didn't look up at them, but whatever.", "We bought one at first, but we liked it so much we have three now.  It's great for meetings in the office with remote employees.  They can see the people talking, each of them, as they talk, with focus.  It makes for much better communication, much better than just a speakerphone.", "We tried many diffwerent options and the meeting owl worked the best.  Clear picture with whole room view as well as following the person speaking(splitting the screen if more than one person is speaking).  Amazing product!!!! Thank you!", "As many others I love the idea, but hate it in practice.\n\nThe sound is definitely better than a laptop mic, but it's not enough for a professional setting.\n\nThe ability to move it from office to office is also great. It means you don't have to buy video conferencing equipment in every meeting room.\n\nHowever, I'm not happy with the purchase at all.\n\nThe video quality is so low that it's hard to see the facial expressions of the people in the room, which makes it almost useless for a video-conferencing system.\n\nHowever, the worst part is the sound. I can understand that it can be hard to put a proper 360 camera in the Owl, but the sound should just be perfect. For $799, the sound is worse than what you can get in a $100 expansion mic from Logitech.\n\nOverall, I'm horribly disappointed and would have returned the device if it wasn't because I had shipped it to Denmark where it would cost me a fortune to return the device.\n\nWe are now looking into Logitech solutions for video conferencing.", "We have two of these and I'm sure those that attend the meetings outside of our organization will be buying them. Very solid and stable. We'll buy more I'm sure.", "We bought one owl and after 2 days everyone was asking us to add them to all the conference rooms.  Great for all of the video conferences we do and just works with everything we've hooked it up to.", "Our remote video conference employees appreciate the way the Owl figures out who is speaking and splits the video to show the speaker.  Facial expressions can sometimes tell half of the story.\nThe Owl setup was quite simple, and easy to use with our video conferencing software.", "perfect", "Great product. Platform agnostic, plug-and-play, OTA software updates. Activity tracking of the camera/mic are fantastic and our meetings are much better off for it. We've bought them for all of our meeting rooms.", "This OWL is superb as it's capable to use a mobile app to control the camera. Also to comes with built in speaker and mic as well. The only thing you can't do, you can't  zoom the camera and the speaker is too soft even with max volume.", "This has been a huge asset to our growing company that is spread out all over the place.", "Works in a huddle space, small and medium conference rooms. As an Av manager I find this to be the easiest plug and play device on the market. It really allows you to feel like your part of a meeting rather than seeing a fixed shot of a distant room.", "We absolutely love the Meeting Owl and the people we conference with love it even more. We\u2019ve got two of them and the work perfectly.", "I like the feature where it deep scans everyone's facial expressions, eye movements, skin temp etc and gives you a way to know if anyone is lying or even being misleading. Very useful!", "great conference room addition", "I think this is an awesome product, the only thing I wish was different would be if they offered a  video sharing software.", "The Owl has been an awesome addition to our weekly all-hands meetings with our remote team. About half our company is remote and having the owl in our main conference room really helps make our remote folks feel like they are in the room with us!\n\nThe sound quality can echo sometimes and can be difficult to hear but that may also be due to the acoustics of the room. I would highly recommend this product and we will likely be buying more for other conference rooms.", "We had logitech camera with a mic before, and we couldn't get sound or video work properly and communication was bad. I researched and found about OWL. We had a meeting et up and the their marketing demoed it and we were sold. We love our OWLS (yes, we have two for our two offices). So far no issues and video and sound are so clear. I may sound pricey, but it is worth the investment. Also, we have paired it with Zoom and I love how the two systems integrate.", "Amazing!  Very cool and we use at almost every meeting!  It will change your next meeting.\nWorth it!", "The camera works well to find and focus on the speaker but the microphone and sound on the Owl is really poor. We\u2019ve had problems with echoes (emanating from the conference room with the Owl), problems with the microphone missing the speaker \u2018a voice for short intervals, low quality speaker. They sacrificed microphone and sound for the cool dynamic camera and it\u2019s not worth it.", "This is a significant upgrade to typical webcams and reminds me of the $10K+ multicamera videcon panels from Cisco.  The Owl does a great job of zooming in on the individuals that are speaking and really does a good job of making remote viewers feel like they are in the same room.  The microphone does a great job of picking up individuals sitting within ~6 feet of the table (doesn't do so well picking up individuals that are standing).  The speakers in the Owl are loud and clear (typically much louder than the maximum volume on a comparable dedicated speakerphone).  I Will probably order several more for each of our conference rooms.", "The Owl allows us to include remote employees in small (2-6 people) staff meetings.  The sound is excellent, mike picks people up well, and the innovative video is great.  Our remote staff report a huge increase in meeting experience with the Owl.", "we love the owl.  makes it so that everyone on our 15' square conference table can be seen and hear during a web conference.  we've started putting them in every one of our remote offices.  we've bought 6 already.\n\nedit: we're now at 9 owls.  I just wish they made a tripod mount for the owl.  we often have presentations in a lounge area with a speaker that is walking around.  I have to make a platform on top of a coffee table to put the owl at a reasonable height for him walking around.", "Camera is well built, love the concept. Picture quality is not that clear and for $800 it should really come with a carrying case. Overall I am happy with the camera, the audio, and the 360 view it captures", "We have one of these in our office and everyone avoids using the conference room that it's in because the audio quality is so bad.  It definitely does do all of the cool speaker tracking stuff, but all of that's worthless if no one can hear you.", "People were skeptical at our office when I said let's get one and try it; was it really worth the price, would using it be difficult and fussy? It is now a big hit, it is easy to use and everyone loves the user experience. I feel vindicated. :)", "We had the same problem with google meet/hangouts as the volume was low. to increase the volume, you need to do it within the meeting through the google meet/hangouts or any other software.\nGo to settings,\nclick on the remote user video screen window,\nclick on sound icon,\ntoggle volume.\nAfterwards the sound is much better.\n\nEveryone who experiences Meeting Owl in our conference rooms love the experience.", "The Meeting Owl functions exactly as advertised.  Flawlessly.\n\nAnd since our initial purchase, we have received two updates that make the Owl function even better than before.  The speaker focus is snappy and the audio clarity is phenomenal.  I think a lot of negative reviews for this product stem from a misunderstanding of how to use the Owl.  The Meeting Owl will not work for every video conferencing situation.  But when used properly, the Owl creates a truly unique experience for remote participants.  I just wish everyone we video conferenced in with had an Owl as well...", "Weekly meetings", "Attached and tested with a corporate zoom installation. Video quality is significantly worse than a $100 Logitech USB webcam. Audio quality worse than a $100 USB Jabra speakerphone. Additional issues that may or may not matter to people: No way to change the camera setup of panorama on top and focused speaker on the bottom. You can move the focus manually using the phone app, but you can't make the panoramic view go away. The Owl itself doesn't strictly \"require\" a wifi connection, but installing the phone app and connecting it to wifi is the only way to get updates for it or access any of its non-physical controls. Owl Labs states that installing the phone app and connecting to the Owl will eliminate the annoying \"Get the app\" splash screen that comes up when it starts AND IS BROADCAST TO YOUR MEETING PARTICIPANTS. It did not. Every meeting we tested had that splash screen broadcast to all meeting participants. Additionally, there is an Owl Labs logo overlay on the video output, and that is also broadcast to participants. So... Owl Labs is using your VTC solution as an advertising platform for their product.", "Very good", "We received one of these at our workplace for testing. This group runs many hundreds of videoconferencing connections every year and is well-versed in the technology. The idea behind the camera is an interesting one, but this implementation still needs some work. The image resolution is a good bit lower than I would expect from a modern videoconferencing camera. Images are muddy and straight-line structures are very clearly pixelated. While the device can be plugged in via USB to a computer as a camera input, it wants you to use a mobile device and app to log in to a wireless network to obtain firmware updates. This process is not at all smooth, as it refuses to connect to standard corporate wireless networks and fails to request necessary credentials for logging in. Finally, units are registered not to the e-mail address supplied, but to the domain as a whole. This means that after I registered this device to our group's email address, I found that I had access to the analytics of every single device at our very large institution. This is a significant issue for data security. What does work well is its ability to identify sources of sound to put on camera, including open doorways where there may be people talking well down a hallway. Perhaps some image analysis would help here, so that the device checks to see if there's an actual human in that part of its field of view before putting it on camera.", "Amazing for office use. Easy to use and install. Loved it.", "The Owl has been a wonderful addition to our conference room, especially for me as a remote worker. With the Owl, I feel like I am right there in the room. The unit has been particularly helpful in our larger team meetings because of its ability to focus naturally on the side conversations just as easily as the primary speaker. This feature is great for getting a full perspective on what is happening in the room letting me decide where I can contribute to the conversation best. And because the Owl is generally centered in the room I get a better view of the team's body language and what they really think of the conversation, which doesn't always come across in conference room systems that are positioned at one end of a room. It's also affordable when one of those fancy conference room systems is just a bit too much for the budget, but you need to stay connected with your remote teammates.", "The meeting Owl 360 is amazing for remote meetings. Easy to install and use! I would highly recommend it to everyone!!!", "I was a very happy beta participant. The Owl delivers on its promises. It's been a big hit at our company and really improved our meeting experiences on both sides of the wire. For those on the remote side, it's been a huge improvement to make us feel more connected and more a part of the room. Those on the Owl side love that there's no more fussing to get devices set up or adjusted. The 360 degree camera is very cool and does a really good job of moving its focus quickly from speaker to speaker. The mic is excellent. It's easy to set up, and once it's plugged into USB it basically operates itself. It's fairly portable to move around to different meeting rooms. Plus, it's cute (it hoots!).\n\nCaveat: if you don't use a good, modern video conferencing platform you might be disappointed with how that platform displays the video from the Owl -- you need a nice wide window to fit the 360 degree view of the room. So use a good conferencing platform (we switched to one of the popular free ones and it's great).", "Excellent microphone\nvery poor speaker.....very low volume can barely be heard by every one in the room, only the one just beside it can hear it weekly, ended up using another speaker with it\nsent an email requesting support , they never responded\nyou should have iOs app to control the zooming on speaker, android app doe snot work", "Works great.  Buying more", "We really want to like the owl but it's having mixed reactions around the office. Sound quality is great in Google meet. Picture quality is a bit grainy overall and has issues with the windows in our conference room. Speaker volume just isn't as loud as we'd like. And when used with our uberconference account, sound quality really suffers.\n\nUpdate after a few months - audio quality has been getting worse. There's no background noise reduction and sounds like sirens that are 4 stories away deafen meeting attendees.", "I work for a company with about 26K employees, where infrastructure is pretty locked down but we realize that \"digital is coming\" and that we have to be more flexible. My review is really for the corporate IT department trying to figure out what the heck this thing is, is it a security risk, and where do we go from here.\n\nFirst, we wanted to know that this can be used in fully stand alone mode-- USB only-- as a webcam. It can. Internet is not absolutely required, it does work with Pixelbook and Chromebooks, it does work with Windows 10 with no additional manual driver loads required.\n\nIT does do what it claims, scanning the room, identifying humans, making them the center of the video when they are speaking as you would expect from a very large, very expensive video conferencing system. The video quality was \"good\" but I wouldn't call it exceptional.\n\nNext: Firmware updates. Yes it does require some kind of wifi based internet connection and a smart phone app to initiate firmware updates. At this point we have users using their smart phone as a mobile hotspot to manage firmware updates. We don't allow unauthenticated devices without MDM on our wireless network today, so this was the most logical short term workaround.\n\nNext: Can it be secured? Not really. I thought it was running Android, haven't been able to confirm what OS is on it.\n\nFinally: The Registration: This is probably the part that, at first was the most concerning from a corporate IT perspective. It has its own cloud based utilization/ status/ statistics gathering program that allows anyone with a corporate email address who registers a unit to see all of the other units in the environment. I discovered that we had two other units registered. In reality a person could register the unit on a personal email account and we'd never know about it, etc. This is the murky part that we haven't fully settled in on.\n\nAs of now the units are still allowed for use and we haven't made any clear conclusions on starting up an IoT type dedicated SSID, though this is not the only product driving that kind of decision it's certainly one of them.\n\nThe device does accomplish it's goal of making a remote worker feel more part of the team and for that, there were few to no other prefect alternatives.", "The Owl is one of my favorite devices ever.  It is transformational to meet with a group of people and be able to see each one of them face to face.", "Absolutely awesome piece of equipment for our company. We use the Meeting Owl to hold sales meetings in two different cities and they work great. We use them with Office Skype and we are very satisfied. We have tried numerous other methods without this level of success.", "Camera is great sound and voice are ok", "Easy set up and worried perfectly in our small conference room", "Bought this for our stand up meetings, amazing concept and adheres to the present person speaking. Really impressive! Price point is definitely on the higher end, but will help when you have 20+ team members and majority being remote dialing in.", "Very high quality, I recommend it!", "Video is very good. A solid product. The quick recognition of who is speaking is impressive. The only thing that prevents it from getting 5 stars is the audio. We are finding it is still better to dial in to a meeting and use a conference room phone instead of the Owl's integrated microphone and speakers.", "The meeting owl was exactly what we were looking for.  We were tired of attaching a webcam to our conference room displays.  The webcams were never where we wanted them, and they were exactly as Owl Labs explains them in their demos.  You get the birdseye view, and it is never ideal.  The Owl can be positioned anywhere, and the quality is sufficient for small/medium conference spaces.", "This device is awesome. It took a little while before the cameras would shift to the speaker fast enough, but once the AI figured the room out, it was good. What a wonderful, useful and cost effective solution.", "Company support and sales rep experience not great.  I bought a system about a month ago and asked if they will ahve a new upgraded camera system.  Thye did not say anything and now they have Pro systems.  My Logitech $50 camera quality is better than this $750 system.", "We tried many different ways to record the audio of the meeting. Local, remote, cloud, but none is a good quality.\nThe audio quality is fair enough to listen to people during the meeting but we were expecting very good recording quality for speech recognition. This is not the case.", "I like it very much. I bought one. We tried at the office and then bought other four.\nVery satisfied.", "Would like option to turn off noise cancellation to test if audio pickup improves", "It's working very well for our needs. We use it with Zoom.", "I love this product. It's difficult to describe without using it, but\n\nI work in Cambridge and company HQ is in Milan. We use the owl multiple times a week where there are many people in both offices and the Owl's panning to the speaker makes me feel much more like I'm there. It's not a replacement for in-person meetings, but when you know the people on the other side it makes remote meetings nearly as productive as when we're in the same location.\n\nI was reminded of how good Owl is when I had to conference call with a local (I'm in Cambridge, MA) university group who was using a laptop camera. It was awful. I couldn't see hand gestures, I had to figure out who was speaking based on their voice (more difficult when I'm less familiar and it's a large group). It made me really appreciate the owl.\n\nI can't go back. I won't go back.", "We use the Owl with our Zoom account.  Audio and video quality are good and it is easy to use.  Plus, people find the owl appearance fun.", "Cool great for video conference with multiple people in the room.  Although people do get a little more shy about speaking up when they see their picture on the video screen.  The microphone and audio is barley ok.  It will pick up the drone of the HVAC system and amplify it that has created extra noise and feedback before.  Also one of the units if you touching some of the wires it decides to reset itself and we lose about 60 seconds.  We have switched back to just a Jabra 510 in a USB for Audio which works like a champ and is preffered by most people.", "I was looking to buy a system that was compact yet powerful and would be helpful with our large team meetings in countries all over Central and Eastern Europe.  The Meeting Owl met every standard that we were looking for and more.  We tested one owl for a month then bought 13 more for each of our teams and it has impacted our online meeting in a very positive way.", "I've been a regular user of Conference equipment which is positioned under or over the TVs, where it works well you end up with a cluster of people at the far end, who you can't always see or hear (relying on additional mics etc).\n\nThe owl uses a 360 degree view, which shows the entire room, and a adaptive view, which splits the feed to whoever is talking. It works really well.\n\nPositives;\n\nYou get a more immersive feeling of people in a room, and a better focus on the person who is speaking\nBecause its in the middle the audio pickup is good.\nAs a speaker it works quite well.\nThe whole room is view can be useful.\n\nNegatives\n\nThe unit takes a while to start its video feed\nAs its in the middle you need to run a long cable back to the PC, which in my case as been back to the TV.\nI can't control whether I want the whole room in view or not.\nThe overall quality is adequate but not as good as others.\nIt sometimes takes time to focus on a speaker, so you can't see them for 10-20 seconds.\nNo remote viewer control\nYou get the sides of peoples faces as they're facing a fixed TV !\nThe wifi app is useful, but more complex than expected to setup. Its a shame more wifi features couldn't be leveraged\n\nSummary\n\nIt's certainly more immersive than a single POV, and as such we're still testing the water, but we enjoy the two we now have.", "These things are really impressive. I haven't seen any other product that does as good a job of making remote workers feel like they're in the room. The video gives a much more natural impression of seeing everyone than a fixed side view or even each person in the room having their own camera. It's especially impressive that it works well in tiny rooms as well as moderately sized rooms. At large sizes (> 12 feet from the owl) you run into trouble being too far from the mic.", "This thing is perfect for a small/medium conference table.  The magic is all in the 360 camera and the voice tracking.  It really does do what they say; it tracks who is talking and tracks the camera to their part of the view.  It also does a remarkable job of keeping track of multiple talkers in a split pane view on the bottom, all the while maintaining the panorama on the top.\n\nPlus, it takes no installation on user computers; it behaves just like any other USB device.\n\nAnd those eyes... everyone is charmed by the eyes.", "We have group conference calls all the time.  While there are many Web conferencing apps available on the market, the Owl adds a new dimension to \"virtual presence\" bringing a very strong interaction among participating audiences.  Very nice product and would recommend.", "I bought the MO after having articles forwarded to me from (2) different people in the same day about it and then gettting inundated with social media ads... so good news for the Meeting Owl marketing team, your marketing worked.\n\nWe do morning \"Huddles\" where we have approximately 20 people in one room and a few other people remotely video conferencing in.  We use mainly Chrome OS with Zoom running in a web browser.  Our normal setup is a wide view camera on the top of a TV at one end of the room.  The room is fairly large, approximately 25-30 feet long and 15 feet wide.\n\nWe tested it with a huddle this morning and overall it worked well -- some takeaways so far:\n\n* It definitely has a \"cool\" factor -- people found themselves staring at the screen to see if it noticed they were speaking... we dubbed it \"Witchcraft\" :)\n\n* The speed at which is detects who is speaking can vary -- sometimes it picks them up right away, sometimes it is a little slower to respond.  My guess is it is trying to decipher between someone making rustling noises with paper (ie: not important sounds) vs. important sounds like speaking.\n\n* Our room is large -- the remote users noted that the audio was similar to the high end video conference microphone we normally used -- which was an original concern of mine.\n\n* Since our room is so large, one comment is that the people tend to have a lot of \"white space\" around them -- it would be nice if the Owl could zoom in on them, even digitally, to make them look larger... possibly there could be a setting for the type of meeting (small/medium/large room and if people are sitting or standing, or distance most people are from camera, etc).  When sitting I don't think this would be as much an issue as when we stand for our huddles.  I'm not sure if the resolution of the camera currently is high enough to support this.\n\n* The remote users noted it was an improvement to be able to see the face of the person speaking.  Normally they have to guess who is speaking based upon recognizing the voice.\n\n* We had a few minor glitches... there was one situation where my body was directly on a split and MO would not center on me.  I could see my left and right arms but the middle of my body was on the camera split.  I made sure to talk directly at it was not able to pick up.\n\n* The full room view is not very useful when having a large conference (huddle) type setup -- the remote users considered it more \"gimmicky\" and not effective as it was too small.  It also takes up the screen real-estate and so the direct shots of people are smaller.  Two options: A) It would be nice to have the option in the app to turn that feature off.  B) It would be cool if it could  \"auto turn off\" if someone within the same room was not speaking.  For example if only a remote person was speaking, show the full room, but once someone within the room is speaking  then show only the large views of people (and get rid of the panorama) as it is not as relevant.  This may be tough as you would have to figure out how MO could determine the difference between a speaker and the TV [Maybe the app would allow defining the location of the TV in the setup to aid MO in this].\n\n* Along with having an app to change settings -- I may have a number of staff using the device and not be connected to MO for settings.  It would be cool to have mini QR code cards (think index card type things) that we could hold up to the MO camera to change settings.  If my team wanted to turn the Panorama on/off, they could just hold up a QR code to the MO and it would change the setting instantly.  We don't want people fumbling with their phones or having to \"connect\" it if they have not already.  [Feel free to send me a free MO if you use that idea LOL]\n\n* One unintended side effect: The MO makes me much more aware of the bald spot on the back of my head... I can now see it when I look at the TV. :)", "Great Product", "Excellent product, works great for our multi-office meetings. We even send them to clients (with a return label of course!) for multi-person onboardings. Picture quality is great, sound quality is great. Simple and easy to set up and use with Zoom!", "Ideal to place in the middle of a small to midsize conference table. To my knowledge, the camera doesn\u2019t zoom, so be aware of that if your meetings require this feature. However, the fact that it knows who is talking and flips the camera over to them is pretty slick. We used this routinely on video conferences with up to 10 people in our conference room. We have recommended the OWL several times to others after they saw us using it.", "My company purchased the Owl a month ago. Yesterday, I participated in a meeting remotely. Most of the participants were in a conference room, while a few of us participated via webex. It felt like I was in the meeting room! I could see everyone around the conference room table, and the device highlights the person speaking. This will save a lot of money on travel expenses. I only wish it was a little smaller so we could travel with it more easily. It fits in a carry-on, but the box is about the size of a shoe box and takes up a fair amount of space. Overall, this is a great product and works well for distributed teams.", "Just got my Meeting Owl in the mail yesterday. I ordered it so long ago I can't actually remember when I did it but it was sometime last summer when they were promoting the heck out of it. It looked cool so I ordered one to try for my real estate business. Unfortunately it took over 6 months to get here and I had already bought another webcam.\n\nNonetheless, I tried it out today in a meeting with some colleagues. We all agreed the constant jumping around as it tries to figure out who is talking is distracting.  One of our team on the far end said it made it impossible to concentrate on what people were saying because she was fixated on watching the camera move around. Maybe it's because we have been using a different camera and are used to a steady view but the experience wasn't what we expected. We'll be going back to our old camera for now.", "We use Microsoft Teams for our internal meetings, and Zoom for external meetings. From day one OWL has been a big disappointment, Keep away from this product, it\u2019s buggy and long way to go before it get to where the company wants the product to be, very disappointed.", "Wonderful and powerfull tool!!!", "Lo pr\u00e1ctico, peque\u00f1o y funcional", "The Owl works as advertised, simply setup (plug in one USB port), and provides a great immersive experience for remote meeting attendees.  We liked it so well we bought three more :)", "Best product in the market for 360 and follow the speaker. Would buy it again", "Love our Owl.  It works well for our small team to connect with our remote employees and clients.  Sound and picture quality are great.  We normally can't hear well with other solutions when on video conferences, but with our Owl, we actually needed to turn down the volume a bit!  :)", "So far this is the best video conferencing equipment we have ever used.  It is a bit slow to pick up new voices sometimes.  It really allows good visuals and good microphones so all can fully participate without frustration. It is pricey but there are not many good options less pricey.", "We\u2019ve used the Owl Leora about 5 months. Very reliable and clear camera. The speaker is great. Also, I like the portability of it as we move it from meeting room to meeting room. I actually took it out of town to a remote board meeting. Worked great. Since we show some smaller products during our presentations, I love that we can move the Owl clofser to the presenter versus having to use ha zoom thingy.

Cell phones take amazing photos these days, but they can run 10x the cost of this little camera.  You get to hold your photo in your hand almost immediately, rather than just having another in your online stash.  It takes you back to the old Polaroid days.", "We LOVE that this camera prints photo stickers in under 30 seconds (that don't need to be flapped around or left to develop like the Polaroids I saw a couple years ago). It arrived charged enough for us to play with it right out of the box and comes with 10 photo sheets. We immediately tested it by taking a photo of our dog before getting pics for our youngest of her with each of her three family members. She loved being able to peel the backing off and stick them right on her play kitchen. We are pleased with the photo quality and the auto-flash (which turned on or didn't depending on which way relative to the window we faced the camera). And I'm enjoying this incredible combination of a blast from the past (I'm a 90s kid) and modern technology.\nThis is great for people who love gadgets, families, high schoolers, and teachers who need to print photos of kids for cubbies and the like. It would also be an awesome way to create personalized party favors for guests - just snap a photo of the birthday kid and the guest and hand the guest the printout!\nYes, the sheets are about $.50 each, but last time I checked, a standard photo printer cost $.30-.50 to print a photo. That doesn't provide instant gratification, it doesn't include a sticker backing, and it isn't available on the go no matter where you are.\nSome tips:\n-The CLIQ+ offers more features but it also uploads your photos to Canon (and Canon has rights to them!), or at least can based on the user agreement. This one is not connected to anything via Bluetooth or Wifi.\n-The viewfinder is just slightly off-center from what prints. There's a barely visible guide in there, so look for that before framing your subjects.\n-It's super easy to press the shutter button, so be careful! I accidentally got a sideways picture of my staircase.", "This little camera is great for novelty situations, but isn't really a viable option for those who want great pictures. The paper isn't cheap and the picture quality is really lacking. In fact, I would say the traditional Polaroids are better quality than these are.  Perhaps the long term fading isn't quite the same, but I wasn't real impressed with this camera.  If you want to have the assurance that your pictures aren't floating around cyberspace, or the fun of seeing them printed out instantly, it could be worth it.  If you are looking for high quality instant photos, I don't think you this will work for you.", "Great little camera!", "On the surface this might look like a great stocking stuffer. But the reality in execution is anything but.. Yes this is a digital camera that will write images to an SD card (not included). BUT - the camera will not take a picture unless you have the Zink paper loaded in. Every button push prints out a photo at a cost of .50 per shutter activation. If you're thinking this might be a fun toy for a kid, think again. Printing is not optional.\n\nThe 5 megapixel sensor is also very low quality, producing images that remind me of the front sensor one might see on a cheap imported smartphone. Even moderately lit scenes produce lots of noise in dark areas on the digital image, and the printed images are washed out and bland.\n\nWhat's worse is that despite having a printer on board it can't connect up to anything else. There's no bluetooth for printing out smartphone photographs, and all its onboard USB connection does is charge the camera.\n\nIn short this is not worth the purchase. The $160 step up from this one (called the Cliq+) might be worth considering given that it does allow printing from other devices and includes a flash that this device lacks.", "I know this camera has a lot of negative reviews, but I didn't have any issues. It worked perfectly for me. The picture is a perfct wallet size (2inx3in), and while they aren't as clear or as detailed at digital I didn't expect them to be. For a polaroid camera they were great, and my kiddos seem to love it!", "This product is suppose to bring the polaroid style with the digital camera. I mean it is a decent size and doesn't come with a carrying case but it does come with a wrist band. It also comes with 10 blank picture cards. When I took the picture it doesn't give a real indication on when it will print out. It just has light on top which will show that. One of the biggest things about this is the capture button is way too sensitive and once you take the picture you literally can't tell the camera to print or not to print so it will auto print whatever picture it takes. There is a small mirror in the front for selfies. Although for the price you pay for the camera, I really wish you had a screen to really see the picture you are taking since you literally have no idea if the picture looks good or not and it will just print it out. It does have a micro SD slot for you to store the picture. Overall I do not think this is a great camera to have. It had decent quality picture if you have a steady hand in my opinion. I do think this product could use some work and give you a bit more features for the price you pay.", "Camera with poor image quality will not enjoy handling it.  Do not waste your money buying this product.  Poor Image Quality", "The design is just perfect as it makes it easy to carry around everywhere that you go. It is a stunning camera, too.", "I am obsessed with the look of this red instant print camera. I personally use it a lot to take selfies because they always come out looking so great thanks to this camera!", "I love this camera! It's the right size to fit in your pocket or purse.", "I love how small this instant print camera is that way I can take it with me on all of my trips. All that it needs is the paper, too!", "This camera reminds me of the fun I used to have with Polaroid cameras back in the day. Of course, the size of this camera is a fraction of the size those old cameras were and actually easier to use. However, much like those old Polaroids this camera definitely has its limitations.\n\nThe biggest limitation is that you can only really use it for close-in shots if you want to see any detail, especially considering how small the actual prints are. If you try taking any pics from more than 15' away or so it becomes impossible to see any real detail or identify anyone in the picture.\n\nIt is a great selfie camera and is a lot of fun to use when you are out with friends. The photos paper is pretty expensive though, just like with Polaroids. Just be sure to keep that in mind. If you want to be able to take close-in pics and print them out instantly without having to carry around a separate printer, this is about the best choice out there right now.", "This camera takes not so great photos, but I don't think the point is to have a beautiful perfect picture.  It's on par or slightly better than most of the polaroids Ive taken.  It's compact, although not compared to modern day phones and digital cameras.  Super simple, turn it on, press the button, and it prints, that's about all there is to it.  Refills aren't bad, running about 50 cents per print (2\" x 3\")", "This is such a cute, blue instant print camera! However, apart from its looks, it is also so easy to operate and it produces such quality photos.", "Pretty fun. My young teen likes it.", "I wanted to be able to get a camera that could take decent instant photos to hang or use as a sticker right then and there. With the advent of the digital age, I take lots of pictures, but end up printing very few, so I wanted something I could have fun with here and there.\n\nWhen I got this Canon IVY CLIQ Instant Camera Printer, it was easy to charge using their included cord, and simple to install the included 10-pack of photo paper, which also has the option of using them as an instant sticker. After taking a few pictures in bright light conditions (and a couple in lower light conditions, as well), it quickly became apparent that none of the pictures were going to be good quality. It's bad. I mean, I knew they weren't going to be like digital photos, but I expected at least old-style Polaroid quality, or something similar to that. The colors weren't even close to on-point, details are not distinct at all even when taken up close, and ALL pictures just look like they're...faded/fuzzy, for lack of a better term?\n\nI'm going to let my youngest son play around with the rest of the pictures, but I honestly don't see much point in getting more paper for this. If it can't even print a half-way decent picture anywhere close to the quality that I could get in the 80's with an old Polaroid camera, what's the point? At this price point, there's no value for this at all, not to mention that the paper you need to buy to replenish your meager 10-pack supply isn't cheap, either.\n\nWhile this technically \"works\" and is \"easy to use,\" I expected much, MUCH better from Canon. It's just a junky toy, and you can get far nicer toys at this price. Would not recommend at all, which really bums me out, as I wanted to love this.", "My daughter bought a Fuji Instax camera a couple of years ago. All of her friends have one, too. Any comparisons that I make will be with the Instax. The kids who use the Instax want printed pictures NOW. The quality of the Instax pictures is just so-so, but they get the pictures immediately. The quality of the pictures from the Cliq is just so-so, too. They're a little larger than the Instax ones plus these are stickers if you want to use them that way. You can always leave the sticker backing on them and keep them just as small pictures. This camera is priced about the same as some of the Instax versions, though you can get some models for cheaper. The film prices is about the same, too. The biggest advantage that I see with this over the Instax is the size of the camera. My daughter likes to take her Instax with her, but the size is cumbersome. The Cliq is about the size of a cell phone and can fit in your pocket or purse without any issues. A lot of times my daughter leaves her Instax at home because she doesn't want to deal with it. So if you're considering getting an instant print camera and know that the picture quality isn't going to be very high, then I think this camera is a serious contender.", "**See my review of the IVY Cliq+ for a much better alternative.**\n\nThe IVY Cliq is a fixed-focus camera that takes a 5 megapixel digital photograph and then immediately prints it out on proprietary, tiny photo paper that can also be used as a sticker. It's Canon's alternative to the popular Instax toy \"cameras.\"\n\nFirst, the positives. The photos printed quickly, and did not bleed or run at all. The form factor is good, and the build quality feels solid. The prints are slightly larger than with an Instax, and the camera has an SD card slot.\n\nNow, for the negatives. First and foremost, this takes terrible photos. Color rendition was - in some cases - radically off. Even when the colors weren't terrible, they were often washed out. No one expects high resolution from a fixed-focus camera, but the image quality was far below what I would expect for a $100 device. It's hard to tell if the issue is with the camera itself, or with the ZINK paper (which I suspect is the more likely culprit).\n\nIn addition, it is far too easy to accidentally snap a picture, which not only means wasting paper, it also means having to wait for that photo to print before you can take the shot you want. Even if it meant a higher price, a MUCH better option would be a camera with a screen that allows you to choose which photos you want to print.\n\nAt half the price this might be a fun toy to give to a young person wanting to decorate their notebooks and their lockers with oddly-shaded photos of friends. You might also use it when packing for a move or storage, to take a picture of the contents of a box and then slap that picture on the lid.\n\nNonetheless, in a world where nearly everyone shopping for this product has a phone that take much, much better photos, it's hard to find a niche for a product that performs this poorly.", "This is an awesome camera.  It is great that you can click a photo and then print from your camera.  The quality of the pic is nice.  It is great to use to photos for a scrape book or a photo album...  The yellow is awesome.  You will be able to find it anywhere.  A must have...", "As my screen name indicates I am a career professional photographer, published in numerous newspapers and magazines. Why would I have the slightest interest in this camera? Because it has a purpose, and sadly, based on reading several reviews it appears there are too many expectations for it to be something it was never intended to be.\n\nPICTURE QUALITY\n\nI have taught photo workshops for 13 years. One of my strongest beliefs is that cameras don't take pictures, people do. Why even mention that this has a fixed focus lens or that it is rated as 5 megapixels? Neither is important. More megapixels don't make better pictures, and what this camera has is more than capable of producing the 2x3 inch pictures it's intended to make. Those photo stickers ARE the final result, the user will never make poster size enlargements to warrant needing any higher resolution. And taking into consideration the intended user of this camera, not being able to change the fixed focus lens is actually an advantage.\n\nCOMPARISON TO SMARTPHONES\n\nAgain, there are comments totally missing the point of the Cliq. Sure everyone has a smartphone and sure most of those have impressive cameras, and sure you can take a picture then take it home and edit it and print out a nice full page image on glossy photo paper using a couple of dollars worth of ink and paper. But you can't use a smartphone to snap a pic of your BFF making a silly face at you between classes and instantly print out a couple of stickers you both can put on your locker door. Will those pics look like the cover of Rolling Stone? No, and who cares - if you don't get that you're not the right person to own this camera anyway.\n\nFEATURES\n\nMy opinion is who cares if it has a high resolution viewfinder or lacks a bunch of knobs and dials like a $600 Canon Powershot G7x Mark II, it's a waste of time trying to compare them, so I won't.\n\nHERE\u2019S WHAT YOU WANT TO KNOW\n\nHere are my own observations based on the hands-on facts of actually using it\n\n1. The look, feel and quality of the camera are what you expect from a name brand like Canon, it does not feel cheap or toylike.\n\n2. The number of well-labeled buttons and controls is minimal - a power switch that you have to hold down for a few seconds to prevent turning it on accidentally, the shutter button, a button to select picture size and a reprint button. Someone mentioned that they kept accidentally pressing the shutter button by mistake.  Of course that's user error, but the simple answer is that they shouldn't leave the camera turned on between uses, if the power switch is properly turned off between uses it is impossible to accidentally press the shutter button.\n\n3. There is absolutely nothing technical or complicated about it.  That's the way it is designed and in my opinion that makes it perfect for non-techies.\n\n4. There is no cover on the lens to break or lose.  There is a tiny mirror next to the lens for selfies.  Both are advantages.\n\n5. A short charging cable is included but not a charger. They assume you already have one, but I think they are wrong.  Someone who buys this thing is probably not a high tech person who has a drawer full of spare chargers.\n\n6. The instruction sheet is mostly illustrations and very simplistic, another bad assumption on Canon's part.  Someone who gets this camera may have never seen one before in their life. They need to do a better job explaining what it is and give more fun examples of how to use it.\n\n7. People who grew up using cameras and phones with LCD viewfinder screens will be lost and think this camera is impossible to use without one.  Try to remember that for 100 years people took family photos with simple box cameras that had only one button and no viewfinder screen.  Also remember that with those cameras, just like this one, you couldn't see your pictures until after you waited a week while they were \"developed\" and every picture you took (good or bad) got printed and you paid for each of them regardless if they turned out good.  That retro vibe is one of the cool endearing qualities Canon has brought back here in a world of hurry up, instant gratification and the need for everything to be \"perfect\".\n\n8. This camera uses Zink film, something created by Polaroid almost 30 years ago and is what most of the instant cameras made by Polaroid are using even today.  It is reasonably priced and universally available.  Zink has the advantage of being smudge-proof, water-resistant, and tear-resistant and has a sticky back for instant fun.  It's not designed for serious photography and no one will ever say it's the best film ever.  The limitation with this camera is not the lens or megapixels, it is the Zink film itself.  Now that being said, are the pictures terrible?  No, in fact they surprised me with their color saturation and sharpness.  The first one I took was a closeup of my cat backlit against a bright sunny window, a challenge for any camera, and it turned out surprisingly well. My second shot was of the flowers on my patio table, the colors are accurate, clear and the photo is sharp even though I was only about two feet away.  I included samples of these because seeing real photos is better than reading someone's opinion. Keep in mind these pictures happen in an  instant and you never have to buy expensive printer ink.\n\n9. You may be shocked that the rated battery life is only 25 photos per charge.  There are two things to keep in mind.  One is that this camera prints every picture you take so you\u2019re not going to be snapping dozens of the same shot over and over.  It takes only a speedy one minute to print each picture (faster than any other way I know of to get a decent color photo) and each pak of Zink paper is only 10 sheets.  You can buy large economy sizes but the camera itself only holds 10 at a time. The other thing is the printing process uses heat, which uses up battery life quickly, so remember to turn the power switch off when not actually taking photos, which will also assure that your finger won't accidentally press the shutter button by mistake.  This is a specialized camera so it won\u2019t be your one and only everyday travel camera but rather it will be the one to use for those times when you really want to make instant photo prints, like to use as a refrigerator sticky \"magnet\" of your kids, pets or travels.\n\nTHE FAIRYTALE THAT THESE PICTURES ARE EXPENSIVE\n\nOver and over I keep seeing the untrue statement being made that Zink paper is expensive and therefore this camera is too expensive to use.  The reality of analyzing that starts with the simple fact that these days only about 5% of people who take pictures for personal use make color prints of them, which probably explains why due to inexperience they have no frame of reference how much it costs for photo prints.  I called a couple of photo centers in town and was told that they charge an average of 49 cents and up.  Mail order places cost even more after postage.  The TOTAL cost of printing a photo at home considering paper, ink, ink waste, etc. can start at about 50 cents and go as high as two dollars for the typical common size.  Now compare that to a Zink photo printed on a Canon camera, which requires zero ink (get it, Zink means Zero Ink).  Each print costs 50 cents and you only pay for the pictures you actually take. .  But what everyone is missing is that every other method of printing requires taking your memory card (or film) somewhere and waiting for it to be printed, none of them produce a full color photograph a few seconds after you take it so you can share it and enjoy it.  The bottom line is that comparing this camera to anything else and saying that it is \u201cexpensive\u201d simply doesn\u2019t make sense.\n\nIS IT A TOY\n\nNo it is definitely not a toy, but neither is it a precision photojournalist's instrument either. It's basically what our parents and grandparents used to call a box camera, and no one ever considered those to be toys. I would call it a fun cam, designed and intended for fun loving people, whether they be pre-teens, millennials or Golden Agers - someone who just wants to capture and share a moment with friends and family, who isn't going to take a magnifying glass out and whine that the picture is a little soft or not perfectly exposed. It's the Polaroid camera for today's world, and by the way for those with short memories those old Polaroids were constantly criticized for their so-called poor picture quality yet these days some of those instant photos are hanging in galleries and museums.\n\nMY PROFESSIONAL OPINION\n\nIf you don't understand what this camera is, don't buy it. If you're a pixel peeper or camera snob or thinks it will replace your smartphone or compact travel camera, you don't get it and that's all right. It's not for you. Me, I'm having a ton of fun with it and I compliment Canon on helping to bring back the giggles of instant photography.", "This is a pretty cool little camera. The photo quality is not exceptional, but being able to instantly have a real picture is pretty cool. Photo paper is really expensive so you definitely need to pick your shots. I wanted to let me kids use this, but would be blowing through money.", "I use this camera all the time, especially for selfies. It comes with both a mirror and an auto flash which really helps make sure that all of my selfies come out looking amazing. I also really like the color of my camera. I have gotten so many compliments for it, too!", "I've used this camera for a few weeks now, it's nothing crazy to rave about, but for the idea it's not bad.\n\nFirst off, the camera is made of all plastic and feels cheaply made, so I wouldn't rate it too highly in the durability department.  It prints your pictures instantly and as a note, just like the old polaroid cameras, once you take a picture, you have to wait for it to finish printing before you can take another picture.  Every picture you take gets stored on an SD card if you insert it, but the picture quality stored on the SD card is comparable to what my cellphone ten years ago took.  The picture is not crystal clear, but you can still tell what the picture is of.  On the back of the camera you have a button where you can choose to take a picture that is 2\"x3\" or 2\"x2\".  I'm not sure what the purpose of the 2x2 picture is since it prints on the paper as a 2x2 picture with a blank white one inch bar on the right.  On the front of the camera is a little mirror that is pretty accurate at showing you what you're taking a picture of if you plan on taking selfies... good on Canon for that!\nThe camera uses \"zero ink\" paper, which doesn't print out amazing quality pictures, and in my experience, printed pictures tend to fade after some time.\nCompared to the polaroid zip or a lifeprint printer, the quality of photos are basically the same.  However, if I had to pick a winner in the novelty department in this case I would give it to Lifeprint.  The zip and lifeprint printers need to be connected to a phone app, but who doesn't carry their phone around with them anyway.  I was in the market for this kind of printer/camera because I like to use the printer to print pictures on small paper that can be stuck to an album and use this specifically for scrapbooking.\nAll in all, I wouldn't recommend this camera unless you had your heart set on taking pictures and having them print on the spot.  You'd find better results however, using your cellphone, picking (And editing if you wish) and printing using either the Lifeprint printer or the Polaroid Zip.", "It is so easy to take selfies with this instant print camera thanks to the mirror and they turn out looking good because of the auto flash.", "As the current fad of 'polaroid' style cameras goes, I'll admit that so far this one has the best picture quality of any I've seen. I still wish they'd figured out a way to put a flash on these darn things, though. I tested it in my kitchen, taking pictures of my pets, and the photos were very yellow-toned. It's definitely not my kitchen lighting, because I have taken plenty of photos in there that didn't have that coloring, though I suppose the camera could be picking up on the colors of the kitchen itself (greens and yellowish greens) or even the dogs (both of whom are blonde colored).\n\nOther than the off tones of the pictures, for the price of the photo paper ($25 for 50 sheets) I would have really hoped that there would be an option to choose whether or not to print a picture that you take. But nope, the moment you click that button, you've made that 50 cent decision.\n\nHowever, the size of this camera is great considering what it does, and the actual printed photos (which are wallet size - 2x3\") vs. a true polaroid style, are great. I would recommend this over other polaroid-style cameras that I've tried out the past year or two, for sure...IF you just really want a camera that prints automatically. Otherwise I'd say wait a bit and see if they perfect this technology a bit more.", "I got this for my 7 year old and she loves it. She has a couple friends who has cameras like this and wanted one so badly for herself.\nThe color of the camera is deep and beautiful.\nIt takes pics well. Just have to learn to hold it there for a second after you hit the button as it has like a delay flash. My 6 year old kept trying to use it and would move right away and get blurry pics.\nThey print quickly, look good amd my kid loves sticking them all over her room.\nLoading photo paper is easy, just wish that part was cheaper.", "I am a professional photographer who has owned multiple Canon DSLRs and point-and-shoots, and photo opportunities pop up in my head every day. In other words, I love photography and have been taking a lot of casual and professional photos. The old Polaroid instant cameras have a place deep in my heart.\n\nHISTORY BEHIND INSTANT CAMERAS\nOver the years, as digital cameras proliferated (especially with smartphones), prints had become less and less common. This had forced Polaroid, one of the pioneers of photo prints, and Kodak to exit the film (and in some cases, the camera) industry. More and more photos were casually taken and shared on social media, and the value of any one particular photo was no longer as strong as it used to be.\n\nPolaroid instant cameras (a device with a camera and built-in printer) were no more when they transitioned to a digital-only camera maker, but they have had such a cult following, instant photos were still popular among many. My wife still very much cherishes printed photos carefully laid out in photo albums, and I must agree -- flipping through them evokes a much more timeless, nostalgic feeling than scrolling through digital photos.\n\nIronically, instant photo printers have been making a comeback with Fujifilm Instax (the current leader by number of sales -- as much as over 8 million camera units sold in 2018), Polaroid, and Kodak, a trend set by influencers and social media enthusiasts. Canon decided to cash in on that trend with its IVY CLIQ cameras -- its first instant one -- although quite late to the party. Nonetheless, the company has a lot of experience making cameras. After all, they are the leader in the DSLR space, but in recent years, they have seemed to play catch up to their competition (looking at Sony and Nikon's successes up until just a year ago).\n\nThe IVY CLIQ (and its higher-end CLIQ+ sibling), unfortunately, do not live up to Canon's quality in terms of image quality or prints. That is sad, but at the price they are being sold at, one should not expect professional prints, but more as fun and simple cameras. The prints, however, are not as good as the old Polaroid instant cameras or the Fujifilm Instax.\n\nPROS\n- Fun and simple to use (there's no screen to flip through. Just point, shoot, and save or print)\n- Instant photo printing (takes about 50 secs)\n- Portable and compact\n- Wide 25.4mm lens is fast at f/2.2\n- 5 megapixel (MP) sensor (CLIQ+ has 8 MP)\n- Built-in flash\n- Selfie mirror (CLIQ+ version also includes an LED ring flash around the lens for taking better portraits by illuminating the face more softly and adding tasty catch lights to your eyes)\n- Prints provide a nostalgic, tangible feeling that digital photos lack nowadays\n- Can peel the print's adhesive backing, turning them into stickers (Peel-and-stick)\n- Optical viewfinder to frame photos with before taking the shot\n- Photos can be saved onto a microSD memory card\n- Auto exposure and auto focus\n- Standard microUSB cable charging\n- Reprint button to print another copy of the previous photo\n- Holds up to 10 sheets of Zink film paper. They are smudge-proof, tear-free, and water-resistant (don't dunk them into water though!)\n- 50-pack of Canon Zink paper costs $25, 20-pack is $10 ($0.5/print)\n- 2x2 and 2x3 layout printing options (number of frames per print)\n- 10 Zink sheets included (2x3)\n- No bulky instruction manual is included, minimizing trash and paper waste\n- Long battery life and charged quickly\n\nThe CLIQ does NOT have Bluetooth. As such, this model does NOT have the below functions that the CLIQ+ provides:\n- View on/share from your smartphone\n- Print any photo from your smartphone with the Canon Mini Print app. The same app can also print to Canon's stand-alone IVY printer\n- Use your smartphone as a remote control for group photos\n- Canon Mini Print app can be used to add filters, photo frames, and text to the photos before printing\n\nCONS\n- Printing speed can be considered slow at about 50 secs\n- Canon's Zink film does not print as well as Fujifilm's in regards to colors and resolution (the latter has several years of experience)\n- Photo quality taken by the CLIQ/CLIQ+ camera are not that great\n- Prints are mediocre, but turn out a bit better when the photo was originally taken with a smartphone\n- No bulky instruction manual is included. You have to download a copy from Canon's website\n- Camera will not take photos directly to the microSD card without any film in it. (For better photos, just use your smartphone anyway)\n\nTIPS and NOTES\n- CLIQ and CLIQ+ are known in Europe as the Zoemini C and S, respectively\n- Photos taken in good lighting will almost always come out better than ones taken in darker areas\n- Take photos with your smartphone (they are of better quality), then print to the CLIQ+ with the Canon Mini Print app for better print quality\n\nOverall, I am disappointed as a photographer who values quality. The images taken by the CLIQ/CLIQ+ cameras are mediocre, and the prints are a bit laughable. However, for instant, fun, simple prints, these are GREAT cameras to take with you on the road -- nothing beats taking silly photos with your family, print them, and instantly be able to use them as stickers or keep them for memories. Decades down the road, being able to hold this PRINTED photo of your family vacation... one that your children touched when they were young... will have a MUCH deeper connection than simply looking at the same photo on a screen.\n\nCanon's first array into the instant photo printer market is a nice try, but they have some catching up to do with Fujifilm.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please click the \"Yes/Helpful\" button below to encourage me to write more. Thank you!", "This Canon Instant Camera with Printer is SO fun to use! It is extremely compact and can fit into a pocket or small clutch. The yellow color is very bright and stylish. One of my favorite things about this camera is that it flashes bright lights as it prints the picture. My main reason for reducing 1 star is that the pictures do not come out nearly as bright as it shows they do in the product description. They have a cool vintage look, however, do not look like a picture you took with your phone at all. The paper is easy to load and the pictures print quite quickly. This is a super fun gift for anyone, especially pre-teens and teens, but is enjoyed by college kids and adults!", "This instant print camera is especially great for selfies thanks to the mirror that it comes with.", "I got this camera as a birthday gift and I am honestly so obsessed with it. It is so small and skinny so I can carry it around with me everywhere. It also takes solid pictures. I am pretty happy with the prints as well.", "I'm a huge fan of physical pictures, especially when you can get them seconds after pressing the shutter. The Canon IVY Cliq camera is using a technology called Zink and it stands for \"zero ink\".  There is no ink really storing inside the camera itself.  The camera itself is readily easy to operate.  You turn on the camera, you aim, then fire,  then it prints.  The package came with 10 Zink papers for you to try and you can get more from Amazon when you need it.  There is MicroSD card slot available to you, you could put a card in and it will store the image that you took to the card and you can view them on your computer.\n\nUnfortunately, I'm not bowled over by the image quality from Zink-based cars and printers.  The color and gradients of brightness are not that great.  The images have a very heavy mid-tone bias that makes them feel like something from the past, and not in a good way.\n\nIf you are looking for an easy way to share those selfies or group portraits in the real world, you should get the Canon IVY Cliq camera.", "I had the opportunity to try out this Canon CLIQ camera as part of the Amazon Vine program and it fulfills a function unseen since the days of Polaroids, but it feels very much like a \"work in progress.\"\n\nHere's the deal - it's a point and click camera that allows you to INSTANTLY PRINT OUT THE PHOTO YOU JUST TOOK!\n\nIs it a nice photo?\n\nWell, no. The resolution is reminiscent of photos taken with flip phones from 15 years ago.  Plus, your choice is either a photo two by three inches, or two by two inches (which is a 2 x 2 photo printed onto 2 x 3 paper.) Not exactly poster sized - or quality.\n\nThe camera charges with the ubiquitous Micro USB cord, and it's a good thing I already had some because the cord that came in the box connected well enough to turn on the amber \"charging\" light, but not nearly well enough to actually charge the camera overnight. I sent an email to Canon telling me the problem and they sent an email back telling me support for this product wasn't available by email and please call 1-800.... blahblahblah. Ain't nobody got time for that!\n\nI connected the camera to the USB that charges my kindle every night and by the next morning I had the reassuring green \"charged\" light lit. We loaded it with paper and took a picture. Out came the less than scintillating 2x3 photo. The camera is made of a flimsy plastic, by the way, and feels as if it would fly into a gazzillion pieces any time it were dropped onto anything harder than a pillow.\n\nThis is aimed at people who might think that a \"digital polaroid\" would be a cool thing so if your life is incomplete without low resolution 2x3 photos - your life just got better! For the rest of us.... meh.", "Old-fashioned shareable imaging takes on a new look in Canon\u2019s Instant Camera Printer. A viewfinder image is magically transformed onto a sticker \u00e0la Polaroid-style inkless technology, albeit in a smaller fashion through a digital camera form. There are challenges to this format that mirror users\u2019 experience with the Polaroid models, namely a difficult viewfinder aperture that complicates picture taking range and accuracy. The miniscule viewfinder on the Canon magnifies that problem. Imaging adjustments are only possible by retaking and printing the picture \u2013 you can\u2019t visualize the image prior to printing - a costly endeavor. An image viewing screen would have made this unique camera a more practical tool and less of a novelty. At this price point, for both camera and film, it\u2019s cheap thrills at a high cost.", "Canon has long established a good reputation in photographic equipment.  This camera is mediocre.  Another drawback was that no instruction booklet came with the camera.  The distinguishing feature is that this camera comes with a built in printer that prints very small images.  I can't say I was overly impressed.", "I love the color of this camera, yellow is my daughters favorite color and she was so excited to see the camera was yellow.  It is easy to use and the pictures come out great.  Instant pics are awesome and fun to use.  It is made well and works great.  easy to use.", "The photo paper that this camera needs is so cool as you don't need ink for it and the photos can also be stickers.", "I'm so happy that instant cameras are back. They never should have gone away. Now that nothing is on film anymore pictures are now being held hostage on our phones. I was immediately impressed by the size of the Canon Ivy. The size is reminiscent of cameras from back in the day. It's not bulky. It's easy to use. You can select between two different sizes for your photos (2x3 and 2x2). I took a couple of selfies and nature photos outside, in bright sunlight. None of the pictures came out great. I was really disappointed. The pictures had a grainy quality to them. Bummer. I was really hoping this would replace the my bulky Fuji Instax but it won't. The fuji instant camera may be bulky but it takes way better pictures.", "I didn't really know what to expect from this camera.  It is very thin and light.  It about the same width and height as a normal point and shoot digital camera. (just thinner)  It comes with 10 sheets of Zink (Zero Ink) paper and you can buy more for around 50 cents per sheet.  (2\" x 3\")  You open the door on the back and insert the stack of sheets with the blue alignment sheet face down.  (it tells you how to do this on the packaging for the paper)\n\nYou power the camera on, take a picture and wait.  The LED light blinks about 4 different colors while it is printing.  If you want another copy of that picture, there is another button to press to get more copies.  There is no preview so if you take a picture it is going to print.  The viewfinder has a 'frame' inside of it.  The camera will print whatever is inside of this 'frame' which took a few pictures to get used to.\n\nThe flash comes on sometimes and other times it does not.  The most difficult part for me has been to get the proper exposure.  My pictures come out either too dark or too light most of the time.  That is the biggest issue I have with the camera.  It is not as easy to take a good picture with as a normal point and shoot.\n\nIt is really cool though.  You hear it printing and then it slowly comes right out of the side of the camera!  That is by far the coolest feature. You can put an SD card in the camera to store your pictures as well.\n\nAlso, the Zink paper has a backing that you can peel and then stick.  I had a little trouble getting the backing to come off so if you don't want to use it as a sticker I don't think it will accidentally come off.  I have to use a pocket knife to get my pictures to peel. (just to start it)\n\nPros:\n-Cool factor.  A tiny printer inside of a camera.  Very cool technology.\n-Sticky backed paper.\n-SD card can be used to store images\n-You can print multiple copies if you get a good image\n-Thin and light\n\nCons:\n-Very difficult to get the proper exposure\n-No previews like standard digital cameras\n-2x3 pictures are pretty small\n-Fairly expensive paper for the picture size\n-Not a replacement for a point and shoot camera\n\nIt is obvious that this cannot replace a point and shoot camera.  That being said, it was never supposed to replace a point and shoot camera.  It is a very cool idea and it works ok.  It is amazing to watch it print though.  It reminds me a little of a Polaroid but the Polaroid pictures were probably twice the size of these pictures.\n\nIt is possible to have a lot of fun with this camera.  I gave it three stars because 50% of my pictures were overexposed or underexposed.  It is really not much of a serious camera.  My kid will use this at his birthday party though.  I bet the kids will get a kick out of taking pictures and sticking them to their shirts.", "The prince run about $0.50 each and they are far from perfect. But you will have so much fun with this camera it's totally worth the price.", "It is so simple to get a nice looking print when you use this camera. I love playing around with its functions, too.", "To cut to the chase, the Canon IVY ClIQ is a toy.  It is a large plastic fixed focus camera which is available in cheery colors.  It has an sd card slot and a printer, which uses ZINK 2x3\" film.  There is no shutter or exposure compensation (obviously) no focus, no depth of field.  It is not just an amateur camera, it is a kid's camera.\n\nWhat an unfortunate  way to be exposed to photography.  The colors are way off as is the exposure (well, there is no way to tell how the exposure is until you print, and no way to adjust or compensate).  The printer has a resolution of 314 x 500 ppi, which is about half the resolution of the worst ink jet printer in  our house (and we have some which are much better).\n\nMy daughter is a talented amateur photographer.  She has won some prestigious awards and is a pretty serious amateur.  I thought she would have fun with this, but instead, was pretty frustrated.  For one, the buttons aren't labeled (except for the one which allows you to choose 2x3 or 2x2 prints).  There were a couple of accidental photos, one of the lawn, another just a reprint.  This camera reminded me of how good we have it with a large window on the back of the camera (on most digital cameras) which allows us to to get a really good sense of what we are shooting, but, this is not about photography, it is about selling expensive film, which you will use a lot of if you can not tell how the photo has turned out.  I took several of her, outside (figuring we would have the best shot at getting good exposure, not knowing what iso it was intended to imitate).  I would guess 100-200.  We shot outdoors in the middle of the day, in Hawaii.  That should have been adequate light, and it seems to have been, but in one photo the flesh tones were white (clown white) in another they were red.  The low resolution of the printer ensures that you will never get a good photo.  The only thing which is \"good\" about it is that the film costs about half of what film for the Poleriod costs, but that is color rich film, and the camera has some controls, and the photos are twice the size.  I think this is meant to be a throw away festival camera.  I am surprised that Canon would put their name on it.  Canon makes some good cameras, and we have a photo printer from Canon which is quite good, and about the size of this camera, and it prints at much higher resolution, with more accurate colors, and costs about the same.  In fact, one of my favorite cameras is a little Panasonic Lumix with a Leica zoom lens, which cost about $15 less than this camera  I would say that there is no good reason to get this camera, except that, as my daughter pointed out, it prints stickers.... so maybe you would want to buy it for a 5 year old.  It probably fares better if dropped than the glass lens on my little Panasonic, but that one takes good pictures (and I have no doubt at all that one of the photo printing services would make them into stickers for you if that is what you want.... not instantly, but close).  Actually, if you want instant prints, buy almost any other camera, and the Canon compact photo printer.  It will get you beautiful photos instantly, at a fraction the price.\n\nThis is unquestionably the worst camera I have used since I ordered a miniature \"spy\" camera for $1 from an ad on the back of a comic book when I was a kid.  (That one was also about expensive film, and processing).", "This is a cute instant camera and it has some pros and cons. For the pros, I love the picture quality. The photos come out clear with really good color if you compare them to the Instax Mini by Poloroid. I think the quality of the photos is better. The camera itself is a little more simple than the Instax Mini-cuz they are cute! But the color print of the photo is pretty darn good in the Canon and it\u2019s sticker paper which is pretty neat and you have two size options for pictures on the Canon. I think for traveling, the Canon Cliq is smaller and easier to carry, tho I have a case for the Poloroid that is pretty sweet, the Canon fits into my purse with room to spare. Teens will love this as they do the small Poloroid.\n\nThe Canon Cliq produces really good quality photos with clear detail. For a fun instant camara-I like this. This is a colorful, fun little instant camera with no frills that produces fun, clear sticker pictures. What\u2019s not to like?\n\nAs usual, the cost of the 10 pack of film can be pricey so you have to try and not waste your film. But for fun get togethers, candid pictures you can print right away are very festive and fun.", "All pictures were dark even when pictures were taken outside", "This is a bright, lightweight camera that's basically a point and shoot and print. All you have to do is aim and push the button: The printing happens automatically. The camera comes with a pack of photo paper for 2\" x 3\" pictures, so you'll be able to try it out before investing in more film. When you do, it will run you about 50 cents per picture, which seems reasonable. (Especially if you remember how much we used to spend on film and processing in the pre-digital days.) The picture quality is okay for the purpose, and that purpose is, I'd say, impermanent fun: the photo paper is peel and stick, so these pictures are meant to adorn notebooks and lockers and mirrors, I'd say, not to be passed down to one's grandchildren. This picture will not replace your current point and shoot. It's just a fun party camera that may or may not be worth its price, depending on your priorities.\n\nOne problem with the camera is that it prints anything you take automatically, so if you accidentally press the shutter button you're getting a horrible picture printed out, whether you want it or not. The problem that bothers me more, though, is that it's very hard for me to see the frame in the viewfinder, the lines that demarcate what will print. Against certain backgrounds I can see some of them, usually not all of them. It's pretty annoying. Maybe if I had perfect vision it would help, or if I wore contacts, but with my glasses on or off I find that I'm just not able to frame a picture easily because of this problem. Your mileage may vary.", "The prints come out very resistant to smudges and tears and even water which I am very pleased with!", "This is such a cool little camera! I love being able to have hard copies of photos to print and share with my friends at events and to have as keepsakes vs scrolling through my phone to find them. The print quality is OUTSTANDING and the price is wonderful too. This is probably the best accessory to have this summer!", "This is a cute instant camera and I have had no issues or complaints with it. It's a novelty camera. It's not high end or high tech, but that's ok. For what it is, it works very well and does what it should.\n\nThe pics dont look bad in my opinion. It takes about 15 seconds after snapping a pic until you see it start to print out and then a few more seconds until it's done. Mine have turned out clear and reasonable quality for the camera. No distortions, no blurry or otherwise 'messed up' pictures.\n\nIt's fun to use and the pictures are nice physical memories instead of everything being online or in our phones.\n\nThe selfie mirror is just big enough to be able to see yourself and has printed out accurately based on what I see in it - meaning that what you see in the mirror is what prints.\n\nFilm loads easily. Theres a light that let's you know when battery is low, when film is loading, film is printing, or is jammed. It will light a different color or pattern per action.\n\nYou can change the aspect ratio by simply pressing a button, as well as reprint with just a press.\n\nCharges fast and you get a decent amount of prints per charge.\n\nIt's cute and fun. I like it.", "Like ease of use. Picture quality good but not great but realize just point and shoot camera. Fun to use.", "This is very easy to figure out and has a decent picture. Certainly not professional level, but good for vacations for the average photographers. Packs well in a suitcase or pocket. Simple and comfortable to hang onto. I like the sticky back paper. You can also scrapbook photos etc. The auto flash and photo duplication function works well. Pretty good smudge resistance. You can get a three year warranty through the company. Seems fairly durable.", "How much you like this camera will have to do with what you're comparing it to.\n\nCameras have come a long way over the years and we're use to the luxury of working with digital images that let you choose whether or not one is nice enough to print, and can use software to enhance photos to fix any flaws. So if you're comparing this one hundred dollar camera to the digital photos you can take with your one thousand dollar cell phone or DSLR camera, yeah you're not going to be pleased with the results.\n\nNow if you're looking for the nostalgia of instant print cameras like the original Polaroid, then this is actually a great option. I have two other newer instant print cameras, both made by Polaroid and the cost of the paper for those is crazy. Like so bad, had I realized the paper was that expensive (and they don't even give you any to start with when you buy the camera) I'd have never ordered them.\n\nThis Cannon however not only comes with paper, but the replacement paper is less expensive than the Polaroid options. Not that the Cannon paper is super cheap, but these types of cameras and their paper never have been inexpensive. Even 50 years ago when they more common, they were still expensive.\n\nFor an instant print camera, the pictures come out well. These aren't good low light cameras. The better the lighting (like outside on a sunny day) the better your photos will come out. And yes if you don't get the photo you want, you have just wasted a piece of the paper. That's how it always has been with these cameras. They never have been professional. They're all about just fun novelties.\n\nMy teenagers love this camera and my daughter buys replacement paper for it often. Teens these days have all kinds of digital photos on their computers, social media and their phone,  but not that many actually in hand. So my daughter loves the idea of taking a photo and it printing right away. She and her friends take the camera to dances and when they're out together, and get all kinds of fun photos together with it.", "This camera is a lot of fun! Sometimes you want to take pictures right away and share them with your friends. Of course, the quality is not going to be anywhere near the quality you can receive on a cell phone (not to mention a DSLR). I also don't love that the cartridges are pretty expensive on this film. It is high enough to where you get upset if you mess up a shot and waste the film.\n\nThe film is pretty easy to insert and remove. I didn't have any problem with getting the photos to work. It is a fun camera to play around with. I personally love capturing moments and would rather have them high quality and get the actual photos printed later. However, if you need low resolution photos immediately this is a great option. It is fun to use.", "Ok, first of all, let's get this out of the way. I'm a professional photographer...but don't worry, I'm not going to review the Cliq as a serious camera. I'm reviewing it as something for my wife (who prefers prints to digital images) to use, or for a kid to carry around.\n\nWe obtained the yellow Cliq, and honestly, it's adorable. Everybody who has seen it has said the same thing.\n\nOnce we charged it up, I took it outside to take some images of our neighbor's flower garden. One thing I noticed RIGHT AWAY is the shutter button is REALLY sensitive, and every time you hit the shutter, you get a print! In the first 15 minutes of use, I accidentally hit the shutter 3 times, and got 3 print outs of nonsense.\n\nThis brings up one of the worst things about this camera/printer: you get a print of EVERY image you take, at about $0.50 per print. Every image. You don't even get a chance to review the image before it prints out - you take the shot, then it starts printing....which leads me to another negative: the printer is agonizingly slow. I didn't time it, but it felt like it took 30 seconds, or more, to print out each shot, and while this is happening, your camera is a brick with a wrist strap.\n\nMy wife used the Ivy Cliq this past weekend, visiting her family out of state. She had thought our 14 year old niece might be interested in the camera, especially since yellow is her favorite color, and if this happened, she was planning on leaving it with her. Well...this didn't work out.\n\nShe gave the Cliq to her niece, and to her 10 year old nephew. After taking one of two images each, they quickly got bored with the delay between shots, and gave the camera back to her. Done. Period. Over.\n\nLet's talk about image quality. It's bad. Colors are VERY washed out, and biased to blue. They're also not terribly sharp, and another big negative, the fact that the viewfinder and the lens are separated by almost 2 inches makes it REALLY difficult to frame your shots, unless you're taking a selfie (more on selfies later). My wife commented that she got very frustrated when she tried to take images, only to find out she's missed her subject, or cut off a hand, part of a head, etc.\n\nFor selfies, the Ivy Cliq has a little mirror (reminds me of similar things some of the first cell phone cameras had) next to the lens to help you approximate getting yourself centered. Works ok.\n\nI provided her a 64GB micro SD card, and the Cliq saved each shot to this card, but she was so dissatisfied with the photos that she had no interest in saving the digital files, or printing them out on our home printer.\n\nShe did use the prints from the Cliq to make a Mother's Day card for her mom, taking images of herself, her sister, and all the grandkids who were there, and her mom was THRILLED with this. Of course, her mom still uses a flip phone that doesn't even have a camera.\n\nOh, I should mention, the prints have peel off sticky back. Nice feature.\n\nI honestly thought our niece would like the camera more than she did, figuring she'd like to take photos of her friends, and maybe stick them on her notebooks, inside her locker, etc., but that didn't happen.\n\nSo, we're gonna keep it around and see if we can figure out when or where to use it. Almost any cell phone camera will do a better job of taking photos. If you need instant prints, maybe the Cliq printer would be a better deal (I presume it accepts images from cell phones, and such), but even then, you're have to deal with the low quality of the Zinc printer technology, so YMMV,", "This is a horrible camera, even as a gimmick one, and that's all this is: a gimmick. The picture quality is just awful, and it automatically prints, no matter how bad the picture. The viewfinder is extremely poor and awkward, and the capture speed is slow. The picture quality is not good, though whether that's the camera or the printer is debatable. It's a great idea for pre-teens, but with the cost of paper refills, definitely not practical. You're better off just using a smartphone and a printer.", "Canon really missed the mark with this one. Here's a case of a company trying to be everything to everyone and failing miserably on this \"camera\". You would never find the name Nikon on something like this!\n\nIt takes borderline terrible pictures and while the novelty of printing out tiny stickers may appeal to some, it automatically prints every picture. I'm sure the technology to take the photo then prompt to print, save or discard isn't terribly complicated or cost prohibitive to have added.\n\nNow having said that, if this camera was $29.95, it would be a great toy for a 8 - 10 yr old to decorate their notebook, but at $100, it's too expensive for what it is. Add the .50 per print, and it really adds up.\n\nSo I would have to say pass on this unless Canon steps up their game and makes some serious improvements on ther next generation of this camera.", "Even though I recieved this product for free, this is my honest opinion and experience with this product.\n\nUsing this camera brings back so many memories. It feels like you are taking photos from the past. What a great experience.\n\nThis little camera is so fun to use. It is so simple, and I love how small the photos are. The build of the camera feels really retro, and modern at the same time. A really sleek design. It feels that \"high quality heavy\" it has some weight to it. But at the same time it is really light.\n\nThe photo quality is pretty good for the size. It does decent in low light, and is pretty accurate with colors. Though sometimes around the edges it does tend to have a more retro fading in color. It is not that noticable. But honestly I love the look.\n\nThe reason it doesnt have five stars.\nThe paper to refill the camera is very expensive. You already pay $100 for the camera itself. Yet you only recieve 10 photo sheets. So I can only take 10 photos. You also cannot pick which images to print. Point click and it automatically prints. So you cannot see if it is blurry or not. So it can be an expensive mistake. It can also be a bit slow on the shutter speed.\n\nFor the price I hoped it would have many more sheets for photos. Or more options for printing. Even a screen to see a little more before you shoot.", "I like this camera. It is easy to load and it is easy to use.  Everything about this camera is nice.  It doesnt go much further.\n\nThis is at its base a point and shoot camera.  It's much like the old instamatic were one would look through the viewfinder and shoot.  You would then hope for a proximity of what you wanted.  I have been able to get some decent pictures, they just havent been great.\n\nOne of my issues is the actual taking of the picture.  You take a picture and the picture prints.  You get a pretty nice picture which is also a sticker.  If you are not careful you might get two pictures or you might take another.  The camera is very sensitive.  Film comes in at about 50 cents a picture so one does need to be careful.  It isnt super expensive but it is enough to make you careful.\n\nThis is an ok camera built by Canon.  The body is tough and picture quality is decent.  This is a tough call between a 3 and a 4.  I gave it a 4 because I gave a blast taking the pictures.", "I thought I would get more use out of taking small, thumbnail-sized photos but that just didn't happen.  For one, the cost of the film paper is prohibitive, especially considering how tiny the picture ends up.  For another, I see this as something that you would use for a business for a specific purpose, and not as a private consumer.  Even though the stickers were fun, once I factored in the cost of each, it took the joy right out of it.", "This is a novelty just like all polaroids throughout history have been.  My kids lived playing with this, but the replcement film is a bit too expensive for their taste.  Quality is fair.  But they have phones that take pics, so they lost interest in this real quick.", "So, to start, the instructions included a few words, but the primary directions are pictures. That\u2019s ok. I figured out that the camera needed to be charged using the enclosed usb charging cord. Charging took less than an hour \u2014 the light changes from red to green when it\u2019s fully charged. I followed the diagram and pictures to figure out which parts function in which way, and read a few reviews that said the shutter was really sensitive. Following the very unclear pictured instructions, I loaded up the paper, closed the back of the camera, and shot a photo. Or so I thought. The camera made some rumbling noises and then the top of the camera started flashing red \u2014 it\u2019s supposed to flash different colors as it\u2019s printing the photo. So, I charged it again just to be sure, checked the insagain, and reloaded the paper. Took another photo. The paper came out blank. Ok. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Give up. Nonsense.", "The Canon Ivy Cliq camera is great for everyone, it\u2019s easy enough for my 10 year old to use but still prints good quality photos for any adults who want these cute little 2x3 sticker photos.\nThe lighting can sometimes be an issue so I would recommend using in well lit areas.\nGreat quality photo paper, we stuck one on the back of the iPad and we haven\u2019t had any problems with it coming up after 4 days of moderate use.\nButton on the camera allows the last photo to be reprinted (which is great for friends) or you can insert a micro sd card and transfer photos to your computer.", "I didn't realize how small the pictures would be (2x3). In comparison the old (and newest) Polaroid cameras take 4.25x3.5 pictures. It's still usable, but it makes it seem even more like a toy. We got two of these camera and some of the pictures are better than others. Some of the pictures have imperfections. There are sometimes a line or two per print where it looks like it didn't didn't print for a line. The kids found it fun, but I'm not sure we'll even buy more film.", "As others have mentioned the picture quality is not that of a newer iPhone. However, I wouldn\u2019t expect that from an instant camera. I trust the canon brand and this seemed to be a pretty good product. I took one picture tonight to test it out and I thought it turned out beautifully. It was super easy to figure out the buttons and where to put everything. (If worried about accidental picture prints I would suggest not putting all the film in at once just in case.) There\u2019s also a wrist strap you can attach which makes it easy to carry it around. I\u2019m excited to take more pictures tomorrow!", "This cute little camera/printer was fun to try out. The setup and installation of the printer paper was easy, the pictures it takes are clear and watching them come out is fun. As a person who remembers the old Polaroid instant picture cameras and the cumbersome paper and the chemical application required to preserve the photos, this little camera/printer from Canon is a revelation and shows how far this technology has come.  The ability to send photos to it via Bluetooth is a stroke of brilliance. There is something about a printed picture that surpasses sending from one phone to another that is fun and friendly. I only found one issue with this device. The power button and the shutter are a hair\u2019s breadth apart, and it only came with 10 printer pages. After one successful photo, I accidently used two more in trying to shut the camera off. Since the paper is pretty costly, this is an indicator that one could waste a lot of expensive paper if one is not very careful. I really think the proximity of the two buttons is faulty engineering. However, it will certainly sell a lot of printer paper for the device. If gifting this camera/printer, please include a couple of packs of paper for it. It will make it a lot more fun for the recipient!", "We bought this for my daughter's birthday in June.  She used it a couple of times in June and July but upon trying to use it during our recent vacation, discovered it no longer works.  It has not been damaged but simply stopped working.  It is, ofcourse, after the 30 day Amazon return window.", "This camera is fun. It's great for instant selfies. Easy to use you just hold it and shoot, what you see in the mirror is what you get in the picture. They become stickers if you want. You can put them on your trapper keeper, or the back of your computer, your fridge or your grandma's fridge. The picture quality is great! Very clear. Hard to believe for those of us who grew up in the 1980s when the only instand cameras gave poor quality no matter how much you shook the picture. Just fun.", "The Canon Ivy Cliq is a simple, easy to use instant print camera that is also able to save to a microSD memory card. The caveat here is that the camera will not work without it having photo paper inside - it is primarily an instant photo camera that happens to save images digitally as well. This means it will print the photo once the shutter is released - no option to cancel the print. Styling of the camera is attractive and minimal - although the \u201cLadybug Red\u201d is closer to a Reddish Pink. There is a selfie mirror on the front of the camera.\n\nThe camera has no displays, but it is intuitive enough. There is an optical viewfinder, and lights show the status of the camera. There is a light on top that glows when the camera is ready to take a picture, and color cycles when it is processing the image. Buttons on the camera are minimal - image size (rectangular 2x3 or Square 2x2), power, reprint and shutter. The camera plays a tone when it\u2019s powered on. The status light can be hard to see in bright outdoors sunlight.\n\nThe camera works best outdoors during the day. Under these conditions, images are colorful. Under less ideal conditions, colors can become muddy, and indoor shots need to be well-lit for the camera to capture something approaching a useable image. The built in flash is somewhat useful, but won\u2019t replace a well-lit scene.\n\nThe camera lens is fixed focus, and is a bit wide - which makes it forgiving when framing up a shot. There is a small delay during shutter release, and the print emerges from the camera after about 50 seconds, fully developed. The camera uses Zink photo print technology. There is no need to shield the print from light when it emerges from the camera.\n\nThis not a camera for hard-core photographers. It is meant to be a fun, spontaneous camera that will take and print photos with minimal fuss. It really works best outdoors where there is a lot of light. Prints average 50 cents apiece, so some thought needs to be taken with each photo, but that is part of why instant photo cameras are special. Overall it\u2019s a fun, easy to use camera.", "The photos that get printed can also be used as stickers which makes it so fun to hang up these photos! I've made quite a few cute collages.", "I got this little instant print camera a couple of weeks ago and it is now something that I take with me everywhere. It is the perfect size for carrying around and for taking photos. It also works so well and produces great photos. I could not be happier.", "Fun little camera for not so serious shots.  My teen loves it.", "I love being able to print out photos whenever I am on the go as it makes the prints all the more special.", "I love the concept of this camera - it's very cute and makes for a great little BFF bonding activity. However, the pictures are not that great and it can get kind of expensive buying the paper. At least with the FujiFilm instant cameras you get a better picture - obviously nothing is going to beat a real camera or a phone, but I just wasn't that impressed. Additionally, it feels like a kid's toy over an actual camera. Cute concept and cute design, but execution was a bit off.", "Because I am a professional photographer, my view of the Canon IVY CLIQ+ Instant Camera Printer Mobile Mini Printer Via Bluetooth may be harsh. However, to me this camera is more reminiscent of a toy camera than the old time Polaroid instant photo cameras that it is supposed to emulate.\n\nCanon makes some superb point-and-shoot cameras. I own two of them\u2014the aged but still very functional Powershot S-90 and the newer and most impressive Powershot G7x Mark II. While I didn\u2019t expect the Canon IVY CLIQ+ to match a camera costing more than four times its cost, I did expect decent photos. I also expected decent instructions\u2014although Canon only included a sketch instruction sheet.\n\nWhat you do get is a camera with a tiny built-in printer that uses special Ivy ZINK paper that produces, at its largest, a 2x3 print. After using up the included five sheets, this paper will set you back 50 cents per sheet. The image quality is not very good. Sure, for a selfie it\u2019s fine, but for anything else you will be better off to grab your smartphone. (I never thought that I\u2019d find myself recommending that in a review!!!)\n\nThere are two models. The Canon IVY CLIQ and the Canon IVY CLIQ+.  The Canon IVY CLIQ+ has built-in WI-Fi and can commute with a smartphone using the Canon Mini Print app. The app is nothing to write home about. Yes it can see your photo library and it can remote control the camera to a point but you can\u2019t see what you are taking before hand and there is only minimal control over the camera.\n\nBoth version support a micro SD card. I inserted one but was unable to tell whether the Canon IVY CLIQ+ was accessing it. Furthermore, I had hoped that, without paper, the Canon IVY CLIQ+ would use the card instead. No such luck. The camera refused to work without paper installed inside.\n\nCanon makes some great cameras. The Canon IVY CLIQ+ and the  Canon IVY CLIQ are not among them.", "The idea of being able to print right from your camera is clever, but I have to think that we're too early on the curve to get the best benefit/value from this type of device. This is not one to be an early adapter on, I think. The cost is high, the quality is low. Give it a couple of years and we'll probably see lots of competition and innovation to improve on this idea - because it *is* a good one.", "So far I am loving this camera except the capture button is very touchy it will print right through the papers if you\u2019re not careful. Wish it had an option to print or cancel. The papers are are not cheap. It comes with 10 of the picture paper to start. Light weight easy to use and you can put in a memory card.", "Although I think I'm being a bit generous with my star rating, I'll stick by it because: IF you knw what you're getting and IF it's what you want, this does do the job well... ish\n\nBasically, this is an updated version of the old Polaroid Land camera of the old days.\n\nIt is EXTREMELY easy to use and it gives you mini-pix in just a few seconds, that you can share with friends, stick on book covers, whatever (to be clear, I mean actual hard-copy pictures 2'x3' or 2\"x2\")\n\nBUT: The pictures are NOT cheap; running about .50 per copy (24.95 for a pack of 50 sheets) However, there IS a slot for a microSD chip for greater flexibility. The pics are of decent quality, but nowhere near what even a mid-line camera or, smartphone can do. The controls are simple enough, but they blend in with the body in such a way as to cause you... alright me... to inadvertently snap without meaning to (did I mention the .50 a pic?)\n\nIn short, I think you'll get limited use out of this, but what use you get will be fun!", "This Canon Ivy CLIQ Instant Camera is like an updated version of a Polaroid! It was a lot of fun to use.\n\nI would say this is more for entertainment instead of serious photography. The photos do not come out as crisp and clear as they show on the product page. I understood this was probably the case before I used it so I wasn\u2019t disappointed. Plus, for the price how good could they come out. I would say this is great for like a party or even for kids.\n\nRefills are very inexpensive so make sure to buy the camera with atleast one pack. Only ten prints are included in the camera. I do like that you can add a memory card so you can upload your images quickly and easily. The face recognition does well as long as there\u2019s good lighting.\n\nOverall, I\u2019m happy. It is a fun little camera. Would be great for office parties, house parties, anything like that. Reminds me of a portable photo booth. Definitely recommend!!!", "I really love this blue instant camera. It is so slim, so it is easy to carry around and I am very impressed with its picture taking capabilities, too!", "This camera is great for kids but the supplies are kind of expensive.  It should have come with some kind of internal storage so that not every picture had to be printed.  Also lack of a screen makes it hard to see what you have.  Kids like it though because they like stickers.", "This camera is so skinny, you would never have expected it to be able to print out such nice looking photos! As a result, it makes it really easy to travel with this camera. I also really like the color of it. I would definitely recommend it to others!", "Didn\u2019t care for this camera at all. I should have purchased the one with Bluetooth and edit capability. I do not recommend at all", "As long as your expectations are in line with what this product actually is, you will be really happy with it and have a good time using it.\n\nI bring this out when my family is going to gather and I want my kids and relatives to participate in having fun recording the event in photos. It's really fun that if we get a special one, we can click the reprint button and have it print a second one, and it's easy enough to use that with a few reminders about how we do have to pay for these pictures and so make sure you're getting a shot that you want, my six-year-old can also participate in recording our family events and bond with family members over pictures. The fact that they are stickers adds an extra layer of charm.\n\nWe have good cameras and cell phone cameras and this one fits a niche completely different. Its about the immediacy of the moment and the sharing of special moments with family. The picture quality is perfect for the small size of pictures it creates, but it is not meant to be a high-end camera, it's much more like the old-school Polaroids, which I think all of us probably have a few precious ones in a memory box.\n\nI really appreciate the simplicity of this and how grand parents and children alike can learn to use it and how much fun it is at a party.", "I am obsessed with this ladybug red instant print camera. It looks absolutely amazing and it works like a charm.", "The paper that you feed this instant print camera is amazing as it does not require any toner or ink to get the job done.", "The Good:\n-Compact design\n-Decent picture quality for basically a point and shoot\n-Fun instantaneous gratification\n-Easy set up\n-Prints quickly\n-Can save photos to micro SD card\n\nThe Bad:\n-Zink paper is expensive\n\nThe Bottom Line:\nThis is a pretty fun camera to have around if you like instant printing gratification. I used this while some friends were visiting and it was fun to take some snapshots of their kids and give them the pictures. I think adults were like that\u2019s kind of cool but the kids were ecstatic. The Zink paper also allows you to peel and stick so that was a huge hit. The camera takes a a decent image (5 megapixel) and the printing is fast. The big downside is Zink paper is expensive so you don\u2019t want to waste pictures. Overall, I wouldn\u2019t say you need this camera but if you want something fun and you want to print small photos for people on the spot, this is a great little camera.\n\n*If you found my review helpful, please let Amazon know by clicking the helpful button below!\n\n**Disclosure: I received a sample product from the Amazon Vine program for an honest and unbiased review.", "Not .", "I like how the photos are also stickers that way I can hang them up on my walls to use them as decorations. Indeed, I take a lot of photos on a daily basis because I take this with me everywhere, therefore, I end up printing out a lot, too!

The paper is inserted and it prints after a photo is taken.  The light changes color to let you know it's printing.  Although the photos are small, I can see a creative use for them to carry in a wallet or placed in other locations were small photos of loved ones can be discretely placed."], "hoffset": 10, "voffset": 10}, {"type": "toptoolbar"}, {"type": "htmltooltip", "id": "el565944935922688pts", "labels": ["Contrast, Lux depth, Colour accuracy, Clarity are all on top of the heap!

She loves that she can just connect it to her smart phone!! We live in a world of \"filters\". You can't edit or filter a instant camera BUT you can with your smart phone then print it with this baby!!

With that said, I can explain to you why this product is what you want vs these small vintage-era portable film cameras offer. I bought this as a mother's day incentive so that whenever a holiday comes around, i can print a photo off and give it to them as a friendly gesture.\n\n1. The quality of the photo taken from your phone, is transported onto this device. Meaning, instead of risking wasting film on trial and error, unsure of what you'll get --- you simply take a photo of anything with your camera, and you can print it off. Easy as that. The better (phone) camera, the better end product.\n\n2. Customization. With the onboard software, which I've reviewed and was thanked by the HPSprocket Team, allows you to edit, critique, or just make a photo something entirely new.\n\n3. Personal Achievements: Sometimes we get rewards from our phone, via a email, video game, or just a simple notification. Instead of screenshotting that and sending it to your friend, asking for the same, equal excitement --- you can print that screenshot off, put it in a photo album, and allow yourself to make a bookmark of achievements. The photos I've provided will show you some of the things I've achieved in this year alone and how this device helps with my accomplishments.\n\n4. Stickers. You can apply stickers to virtually any photo you upload onto your sprocket; even as far as taking photos and turning real life animations/stickers/logos and making you're very OWN stickers to apply to your OWN photos! I hope that makes sense; its easier shown than read. You'll get it once you play with the software\n\n4. Up to date software. This is important among all hardware and film. If the software doesn't work, the hardware and YOU, don't either. Updated frequently, with the ability to upload your own photos in case you need that storage on your phone.\n\n5. Film. inexpensive, slightly small, and wallet sized. Depending on the model device you get, this effects the film length/price. I got this model for the cost of film is independent from buying the device.\n\nCons:\nThe color in the photos isn't always the best, and the device needs to be plugged into something for more than 2-4 photos. but the ability to do some of these things with film is extraordinary in the first place; whats the saying? Don't look a gift horse in the mouth?\n\nWith all these these pros, and slight cons, I would suggest this over film any time. You get to practice using digital film, (your phone or what have you.)  the film is inexpensive, and the virtual customization is in any shape, way, possible.\nSuperb choice for those interested in editing photos.\nThe photos above are things I've done with mine. :)", "It works great, connects great, picture quality is what i expected. However, every picture I printed, it would print a red line right through the middle of the photo.  At first, I didn't notice it, then after 3 or 4 photos, i could clearly see the red line.  I thought maybe it was just something that happened that one time, so i printed a few more, and sure enough the red line continued to show and continued to become more and more noticeable.  Now normally, this sort of thing wouldn't bother me, but for the price I paid for this device, I am very disappointed and unhappy.", "Absolute love this .", "Love love love it!!

The  subtle control buttons at the base are too obscure for a common use environment.\n\n-Chuck", "This is so great for a Skype Room or new Microsoft Team Rooms for 4 - 6 people conference...So easy as plug & play", "I was very excited about this web conferencing solution. The equipment works well, being the only one I know with these capabilities. The speaker is good as well as the microphones. However, the quality of the image is much worse than the one advertised in the company's videos. I tried to contact the support, but they said that this is really the real quality. On a regular sized computer screen, the image of simple webcams is already much sharper.", "Good", "I bought this for a conference room in my home. I do a lot of work from home and wanted to be able to have a good camera for Zoom calls with a small group around my conference table. I learned about the Meeting Owl from being on the receiving end of a call with several people around a table. The sound quality was great and I was quite impressed with the device's ability to focus the camera on the person speaking, coupled with the full \"panorama\" view of the room from the middle of the table. I called the host of that meeting to learn what they were using and discovered the Owl. I was about to buy a more traditional camera / audio system but I liked the functionality of the Owl. The bonus is that it cost a bit less than what was I considering. Net net, I'm very happy with the device. It works great, picture and sound quality are excellent, and it connects easily to my MBP. I've been using it on and off for about a month and so far, I have not found any gotchas.", "My company got a beta unit a couple months ago.  I'm normally the one in the conference room with our remote employee who calling in.  He tells me it really helps.  I couple weeks ago I was the one working from home and I got to experience how the Meeting Owl.  It was really great.  Being able to have the main video automatically focus in on the speaker was extremely helpful.\n\nTo your computer it looks just like any webcam.  It works with any software.  I have used it on Skype, Zoom, and WebEx.", "I loved the technology. It works very well, showing a close-up video of all the participants of a meeting, the general view of the the meeting room, and switching to show the person currently speaking. It would be perfect if it had better image quality. It has some chromatic aberration and resolution suffers a little on the close-ups.", "I like the idea of the Meeting Owl.  But in application it is not as sharp or as quick as I would have liked.  The 720p camera is not as nice as I hoped it would be.  Plus the system lags a bit when changing from speaker to speaker or when attempting to capture two speakers at once.  So now I have purchased the Meeting Owl Pro.  It is 1080p which I hope will much improve the video performance and I hope the response time for following from speaker to speaker is improved as well.  I will leave a review when I have some experience with the \"Pro\" version.  Having said all that, this version of the Meeting Owl may be quite adequate for less fussy individuals.  You can get it and try it out for 30 days.  Amazon was very helpful when I returned this one to get the new one - no problem.", "This is a great tool for meetings. The camera picks up sound and focuses on the person speaking for offsite employees to see and hear. I would highly recommend this if you are looking for have a more productive meeting.", "We bought this to run video conference meetings for our company.  It worked flawlessly out of the box.  The tracking is impressive, the camera quality is 720p (that's why it received 4 stars on picture quality, it could be better but it is still impressive).  The sound is perfect and we are using this in a conference room that is about twice as big as is recommended by the manufacturer.  I highly recommend this.\n\nJust as a FYI we use this with ZOOM and they integrate together with no problems.", "Our remote employees absolutely love the owl. We started with one for our main conference room and they insisted we get one for each of our other conference rooms.", "Highly recommend this unit. We use it with Zoom meetings, and it has performed flawlessly so far. It quickly tracks the speaker, and the sound quality is the best we've ever used. The only challenge we've seen so far was that people need time to get used to talking to the owl when they're used to talking to the screen! Setup was as simple as plugging in the USB, and it connected immediately to Zoom. Highly recommended for anyone with remote teams.", "Bought this for my office conference room which seats 6. It is great sound quality and we love how it shows each person on camera and also the panoramic view of the room.", "We all live it- Including our clients.", "It's slow to bring up the video, and the quality on my logitech camera is better. Also - this blows me away, for $800 it can't serve as a bluetooth speaker. really? REALLY?? So now I need two speakers if I want to listen to music while in my office. That's just dumb.", "We've bought a bunch of these for our office.  The camera tracking is cool - it offers a full-pano view of the room + a few following cropped views when it detects faces or motion.  However-\n\n- The sound is barely passable.  Remote folks sound muffled and distorted, and we sound bad to them as well (microphone isn't great.)  I much prefer using a Jabra and a normal webcam for this reason.\n- Image quality isn't great, even in small rooms, everyone looks small and far away.\n- I was expecting this to be 1/4 of the price it's being sold at.", "I just bought this product this week\n This product works as advertised and is really easy to set up. It has totally enhanced the feel of meetings for my remote staff. I use Google Meet/Hangouts.  I can't rate reliability yet, but we're off to a great start.", "Best video conferencing camera/mic combo available. Worth  every single penny.", "I got 2 of them for the office. Great innovativion and concept. Lots of opportunities from the speakers perspective. Quality audio is poor; and volume is too low.", "Owl is really great and has made a big diff in our meetings.  Audio is better than a speaker phone (both mic and output) or tv, and the views rock - in many ways because the camera is simultaneously closer to everyone and also the distance to participants is more evened out.  So you can both see everyone, and make out everyone's face.  And the simplicity is *great* (just plug in and it works, no software to install, extra mics, wires, etc).\n\nSmall asks:\n- It would be nice if the resolved video was slightly higher res so you could read things on whiteboards (without writing super huge)\n- It does seem to pickup HVAC/computer fans just a bit... don't know if there's a way to filter out drone type noises better.\n- Super minor - An indicator on the unit of which way is front (ie, which side is where the split in the panorama view is) so you can split the in-room tv instead of someone's head.", "Good product. People who work remotely for our company really appreciate the expanded views of everyone in the room.\n\nThe sound quality and mic are good. However I feel the video quality could be improved a bit. It\u2019s perfectly usable, but not quite as good as say a mid grade Logitech webcam. Feels a little mushy and slightly underexposed.\n\nGenerally people like it and we\u2019re considering a second one for another conference room.", "Looks super cool. Works as advertised.\nEasy interface... just plug it in via USB and the owl takes care of making all the people show up.\nSound quality is better than our previous VOIP Polycon conference phone.\nOnly recommendations:\n1) it doesn't always key in on who is speaking.  I haven't called support, so they might have a setting or something I need to tweak.\n2) we have a glass wall on one side of the conference room and lots of backlight comes in on that side that degrades the video quality a bit.\n3) our table holds 10 people.  sometimes the Owl has a long way to see folks at the far end of the table and they appear pretty small.\n4) sometimes, where to look if you are in the conf room is awkward.  you want to look the person you are speaking to in the eyes, but that means you have to look at the screen where you are projecting the online participants video feeds.  That is not next to the owl if your owl is in the middle of the table.. so you aren't looking at them when they are looking at you, which makes the non-verbal communication piece still not completely solved.\nI would imagine in a smaller room with a 6 top round table, and no external light coming it, it would be better, but still not sure where to put the screen..", "We bought the Meeting Owl to record meetings, so that those not in attendance can get a different viewpoint than a traditional camera in front of the room. It works well moving around to capture the person that is talking. If someone has a quieter voice, then it has more trouble locating that person than someone who naturally projects their voice or has a deeper voice. The top section of panoramic view is very nice when reviewing recorded video, but it would be a great feature if you could make that top section take up more of the overall viewing screen. For example, the ability to make the panoramic picture take up 40% of the screen instead of a bar across the top. The algorithm for finding voices/people could be improved. You will see sometimes the Owl is \"watching\" nobody, or somebody who stopped speaking two minutes ago.\n  Set up is very easy, two cords two plugs. A neanderthal, if given the correct training, could certainly work the Owl. In fact, the idea that HomoNeanderthalensis was significantly less intelligent than early HomoSapiens may be more myth than reality. Their brain sizes, as indicated by cranium cavity size was slightly smaller, yes, but you can not infer function from size. Case in point; some early Homo species had very large brains, yet we can infer from their evolutionary proximity to aboreal primates and lack of evidence they used tools that they were not particularly intelligent. The human brain as developed a lot over a great period of time. Our brains now contain a vastly more complex structures and compressed amount of neurons than our ancestor's brains did hundreds of thousands of years ago. If you were going to make the argument that brain size alone correlates with intelligence, then you must hold the belief that men are on average more intelligent than females. This is because men often have a physically larger brain. I doubt that someone would hold that belief, however, and it further shows that size does not give any inference about function.\n  Whats more, paleo-archaeological evidence shows that Neanderthals likely lived in complex social units. There have been discoveries that indicate older Neanderthals, possibly in their 60's would have been disabled from injuries suffered, but continued to live on for what is presumed to be decades. This is shown by the healing of broken bones, after all, a broken bone will heal itself if given time and nutrition. So, yes, while the Owl is simple to use let us not disparage our long lost Neanderthal brethren.\n  Overall, we've been happy with our Owl. I would recommend reaching out to OwlLabs with questions or concerns. They appear to be good company, that is to say, a company that is dedicated to serving their customers. It is a novel idea that is useful in a wide variety of applications. Some sort of carrying case/book-bag that protects the device would be a great accessory.  I cannot speak for their take on Neanderthal brain anatomy, or how they feel in general concerning the Neanderthal subspecies.", "Wonderful device .. I use it for my personal customer on-site meetings as we want to get everyone on the call .. I love the experience and how it very well integrates with zoom ..\n\nOnly Con I would say are\n\nSometimes the individual recognition is not very accurate .. and if you\u2019re using it in a conference room with a tv for screen share and audio output (as the speaker in MO might not be loud enough) the individual AI video being generated freaks out and does a never ending split as it thinks there are multiple people that it needs to split as the audio feedback loops in\n\nIf the price is at 500 I would say it\u2019s the best value for money", "Not being able to use this solution with Adobe Connect which wasn't emphasized in the marketing, rendered it useless to our organization.  That said, really liked the approach  and promises of the solution which is very innovative and hope to reevaluate if they support Adobe in the future.", "The Meeting Owl is not your typical video conferencing bird.  This camera/speakerphone combination has a 360\u00b0 camera (no moving parts) and microphone array, allowing the remote participants in the video conferencing meeting to see and hear the entire room. The loudspeaker has a nice tone quality and can get adequately loud for a medium-sized room.\n\nThe Meeting Owl is covered in a nice dark grey fabric rather than a metal grill. Unfortunately, the velcro wraps that I use to manage the cables frequently attach themselves to the fabric. Over time, it\u2019s fuzzing-up the fabric. Plus, the fabric will collect hand oils when the unit is moved around. If you won\u2019t need to move the Owl from room to room, this will be a minimal annoyance.\n\nThe 360\u00b0 panoramic view across the top of the video gives the remote participants a great overview of the room and who is in the meeting. One co-worker calls it \u201cThe Last Supper\u201d view. The remote participants will be aware of everyone in the room. They won\u2019t experience a disembodied voice suddenly coming from off-camera or be surprised to discover that a particular person is attending the meeting but just sitting out of view. This may be a problem for the in-room folk that hate \u201cbeing on camera\u201d - they\u2019ll have to hide under the table.\n\nThe 360\u00b0 camera allows you more flexibility in how you configure your huddle/conference room. You are not limited to a narrow and deep configuration to fit everyone in the field of view of a traditional camera. A round or square table, or even a wide room can work.\n\nThe Owl is tall enough for its camera to just clear a 15.5\u201d screen laptop that\u2019s placed close to it. However, you may need to elevate the placement of the Owl if you have standing meetings with tall people in a small room.\n\nThe \u201cSpeaker Spotlight\u201d view in the main portion of the video window is where the magic happens - automatically \u2018spotlighting\u2019 the person that is talking, up to the three most recent people. This is super handy; the meeting can \u2018just happen\u2019 - no one needs to be responsible to reposition a webcam, or control a PTZ (pan/tilt/zoom) camera to point it at the person currently talking. The free app does allow you to manually override the spotlight as desired.\n\nTip: The Owl doesn\u2019t have an indicator on the unit to show where the panoramic view splits (the far left and right ends). So I put a sticker near the top of the Owl and tell folk to orient the sticker toward the video display to give the best panorama - placing the person opposite the display from the Owl in the center of the panoramic view.\n\nThe video quality is 720p, adequate for typical video conferencing meetings. The video is somewhat \u2018soft\u2019, not sharp, crisp images of some higher end webcams. Most of the time people are either sharing presentation slides or having discussions, not focusing on someone\u2019s skin blemishes, so this may not be a big deal. Plus, many video conferencing systems don\u2019t transmit anything higher than HD and not everyone has the bandwidth to handle much above that either. However, the video \u2018softness\u2019 could be an issue if you regularly have someone writing on a whiteboard in the room. They will need to write bigger and use stronger contrasting colors to combat reflective glare from ceiling lights. Hopefully a future firmware update will improve this particular situation.\n\nFor people accustomed to talking towards a speakerphone, they will naturally face the Owl giving the remote participants a full view of their face. However, many people will naturally turn to the display screen when talking to the remote participants. Depending on where they are sitting in relation to the Owl, the remote participants will end up seeing the person\u2019s profile, or even most of the back of their head! In these situations, either the in-room person or the remote participants may miss nonverbal signals and reactions. Pre-planning where people sit, the placement of the Owl, or even mirroring/multiple displays will help reduce these situations.\n\nThe Meeting Owl can be a great benefit in group discussion meetings. The in-room participants will look at and talk to the other in-room participants. The remote participants will be able to see more facial and physical expressions of the in-room participants, helping them to feel more involved in the discussion rather than disconnected observers.\n\nThe Meeting Owl\u2019s innovative camera and ease of use make it a great option for huddle rooms up to medium-sized rooms depending on room configuration. It can be placed closer towards the person sitting at the far end of the table, and no \u2018camera operator\u2019 is needed. It's a great option to have in my video conferencing toolbox.", "Incredibly easy to set up and use, the Meeting Owl has made a huge difference for our remote workers. During our weekly staff meetings, all of us can now be on camera when we speak and it makes our remote workers feel like they are more a part of the group. The sound is WAY better than our previous webcam and the multiple cameras and speaker focus makes the experience much more inviting. The video is still a little grainy, but I blame that more on our poor lighting than anything else. The Meeting Owl is definitely worth the cost.", "I bought an early model and the Meeting Owl has been great, it does elicit a reaction of either love or fear in some people when they see it but once they are remote in a meeting with one, normal cameras are a letdown. It's hard to describe how much better a dynamic meeting video can be using the owl, it's as if you have a multiple camera tv-studio in your conference room. The audio is clear both from the speakers and the mics for the remote person. Love it and we bought more.", "The owl is awesome.\nI ordered it from the US to Europe because it\u2019s not yet available in Europe.\nThere is no other solution that is that simple and useful.\nAfter the first one I ordere another one for our 2nd meeting room. Very cool.\nEveryone who joins our meetings is amazed now by the visibility it provides.", "The Owl is amazing and really makes connecting with remote teams seamless. The AI around automatically moving the camera to whoever is speaking is truly cutting edge and it ultimately the differentiation against other corporate meeting cameras. Super easy and simple to set up and does not connect to your company's internet directly, but rather through your computer, so any issues around data security/privacy is solved as your already encrypted computer provides all the broadband needed to use the Owl. 100% would recommend to anyone working with colleagues in remote locations.", "This is my second one - first one is in such demand, we needed another.\n\nThese are great for meeting in smaller rooms for upto 12 or so people. It actually holds up better than expected in larger conference rooms, but sound and picture quality degrade. It's all about the placement of people around the OWL and their proximity to the OWL. The larger the room, the further people will be spaced from the OWL, so naturally you'd have diminishing returns. I think optimally people should be maybe 8-10ft max from the OWL.\n\nI love that this is a self contained unit that does all the thinking - no special drivers needed. So far it has been truly plug and play. Plug it in and not only does the system automatically recognize it, but Zoom will usually select it automatically as the default for cam/mic/speaker. We've only had to enter into the system settings once or twice to force it to recognized and used as the default.\n\nFolks at the remote end love that this tracks the speaker. They can see who is talking as well a panorama of the entire group - at the same time.\n\nCONS:\nCost: at $800 it was not an easy decision to make the first time around. After working with one for a while I am sold on how well it works, but still steep at $800.\n\nMics: Not really a CON but more of a wish-list item. For larger rooms it is the speaker and mics that degrade faster than the cam. It would be great if this could work with external mics and speakers. I could then set up my wireless conference mics/speakers around the room and let the OWL handle the cam. The cam still holds up pretty well in larger spaces - better than the single POV cams. Folks really like being able to see everyone in the room with the inside-the-circle 360 view. However, as it is the OWL is dependent on the internal mics to track the direction of the current speaker. I haven't actually tested external mics/speakers with the OWL, but I suspect that it would work just fine, but just not be able to track the speaker. Worst case scenario might be that the CAM would bounce around trying to figure out who to focus on. I'll get a chance to test this out at some point.\n\nItem Reviewed: Meeting Owl 360 Degree Video Conference Camera", "My boss loves it. looks cute at office. it could be great if owl can move a bit more and make sound more.

This camera is perfect! The sound quality is great and the receiving end is also solid sound quality. I will be adding two more to our other conference rooms as soon as we get the chance. The picture quality isn't super Hi-Def but good enough for what its needed for, that could also be the median we are using for conferencing. The one drawback may be having to plug it directly into a computer which is on a wall behind an 80-inch screen, about 10 feet away. I currently have a USB extender running it back to the computer, I suggest if you do this you get one that includes AC power adapter otherwise the signal will not come through as it should. Hope this helps anyone make a decision as it really is a fantastic camera!", "I thought it would be a gimmicky add on to our office space, but we have received a ton of great feedback from our remote employees (and one of our clients actually purchased one for their office as well after one of our virtual meetings).

It has a 360\u2019 view and automatically follows up to three active speakers within that field. Asking for perfect picture quality on top of that is a bit greedy. I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll improve in its next iteration, but considering this is the first version the company has made, they had made a great initial product. When a newer version is out, I\u2019ll probably get it. But until then this is gonna meet and exceed my needs.", "Great feature and unique design.

They love using it with our GoToMeeting platform so they can avoid traffic while still getting to attend committee meetings. In addition, this has been a great addition to our weekly staff meetings with people across the state. This was a great purchase for our organization and I would highly recommend it for any organization or company's conference room.", "The camera does not track people properly.

So far no issues and video and sound are so clear. I may sound pricey, but it is worth the investment. Also, we have paired it with Zoom and I love how the two systems integrate.", "Amazing!  Very cool and we use at almost every meeting!  It will change your next meeting.\nWorth it!", "The camera works well to find and focus on the speaker but the microphone and sound on the Owl is really poor. We\u2019ve had problems with echoes (emanating from the conference room with the Owl), problems with the microphone missing the speaker \u2018a voice for short intervals, low quality speaker. They sacrificed microphone and sound for the cool dynamic camera and it\u2019s not worth it.", "This is a significant upgrade to typical webcams and reminds me of the $10K+ multicamera videcon panels from Cisco.  The Owl does a great job of zooming in on the individuals that are speaking and really does a good job of making remote viewers feel like they are in the same room.  The microphone does a great job of picking up individuals sitting within ~6 feet of the table (doesn't do so well picking up individuals that are standing).  The speakers in the Owl are loud and clear (typically much louder than the maximum volume on a comparable dedicated speakerphone).  I Will probably order several more for each of our conference rooms.", "The Owl allows us to include remote employees in small (2-6 people) staff meetings.  The sound is excellent, mike picks people up well, and the innovative video is great.  Our remote staff report a huge increase in meeting experience with the Owl.", "we love the owl.  makes it so that everyone on our 15' square conference table can be seen and hear during a web conference.  we've started putting them in every one of our remote offices.  we've bought 6 already.\n\nedit: we're now at 9 owls.  I just wish they made a tripod mount for the owl.  we often have presentations in a lounge area with a speaker that is walking around.  I have to make a platform on top of a coffee table to put the owl at a reasonable height for him walking around.", "Camera is well built, love the concept. Picture quality is not that clear and for $800 it should really come with a carrying case. Overall I am happy with the camera, the audio, and the 360 view it captures", "We have one of these in our office and everyone avoids using the conference room that it's in because the audio quality is so bad.  It definitely does do all of the cool speaker tracking stuff, but all of that's worthless if no one can hear you.", "People were skeptical at our office when I said let's get one and try it; was it really worth the price, would using it be difficult and fussy? It is now a big hit, it is easy to use and everyone loves the user experience. I feel vindicated. :)", "We had the same problem with google meet/hangouts as the volume was low. to increase the volume, you need to do it within the meeting through the google meet/hangouts or any other software.\nGo to settings,\nclick on the remote user video screen window,\nclick on sound icon,\ntoggle volume.\nAfterwards the sound is much better.\n\nEveryone who experiences Meeting Owl in our conference rooms love the experience.", "The Meeting Owl functions exactly as advertised.  Flawlessly.\n\nAnd since our initial purchase, we have received two updates that make the Owl function even better than before.  The speaker focus is snappy and the audio clarity is phenomenal.  I think a lot of negative reviews for this product stem from a misunderstanding of how to use the Owl.  The Meeting Owl will not work for every video conferencing situation.  But when used properly, the Owl creates a truly unique experience for remote participants.  I just wish everyone we video conferenced in with had an Owl as well...", "Weekly meetings", "Attached and tested with a corporate zoom installation. Video quality is significantly worse than a $100 Logitech USB webcam. Audio quality worse than a $100 USB Jabra speakerphone. Additional issues that may or may not matter to people: No way to change the camera setup of panorama on top and focused speaker on the bottom. You can move the focus manually using the phone app, but you can't make the panoramic view go away. The Owl itself doesn't strictly \"require\" a wifi connection, but installing the phone app and connecting it to wifi is the only way to get updates for it or access any of its non-physical controls. Owl Labs states that installing the phone app and connecting to the Owl will eliminate the annoying \"Get the app\" splash screen that comes up when it starts AND IS BROADCAST TO YOUR MEETING PARTICIPANTS. It did not. Every meeting we tested had that splash screen broadcast to all meeting participants. Additionally, there is an Owl Labs logo overlay on the video output, and that is also broadcast to participants. So... Owl Labs is using your VTC solution as an advertising platform for their product.", "Very good", "We received one of these at our workplace for testing. This group runs many hundreds of videoconferencing connections every year and is well-versed in the technology. The idea behind the camera is an interesting one, but this implementation still needs some work. The image resolution is a good bit lower than I would expect from a modern videoconferencing camera. Images are muddy and straight-line structures are very clearly pixelated. While the device can be plugged in via USB to a computer as a camera input, it wants you to use a mobile device and app to log in to a wireless network to obtain firmware updates. This process is not at all smooth, as it refuses to connect to standard corporate wireless networks and fails to request necessary credentials for logging in. Finally, units are registered not to the e-mail address supplied, but to the domain as a whole. This means that after I registered this device to our group's email address, I found that I had access to the analytics of every single device at our very large institution. This is a significant issue for data security. What does work well is its ability to identify sources of sound to put on camera, including open doorways where there may be people talking well down a hallway. Perhaps some image analysis would help here, so that the device checks to see if there's an actual human in that part of its field of view before putting it on camera.", "Amazing for office use. Easy to use and install. Loved it.", "The Owl has been a wonderful addition to our conference room, especially for me as a remote worker. With the Owl, I feel like I am right there in the room. The unit has been particularly helpful in our larger team meetings because of its ability to focus naturally on the side conversations just as easily as the primary speaker. This feature is great for getting a full perspective on what is happening in the room letting me decide where I can contribute to the conversation best. And because the Owl is generally centered in the room I get a better view of the team's body language and what they really think of the conversation, which doesn't always come across in conference room systems that are positioned at one end of a room. It's also affordable when one of those fancy conference room systems is just a bit too much for the budget, but you need to stay connected with your remote teammates.", "The meeting Owl 360 is amazing for remote meetings. Easy to install and use! I would highly recommend it to everyone!!!", "I was a very happy beta participant. The Owl delivers on its promises. It's been a big hit at our company and really improved our meeting experiences on both sides of the wire. For those on the remote side, it's been a huge improvement to make us feel more connected and more a part of the room. Those on the Owl side love that there's no more fussing to get devices set up or adjusted. The 360 degree camera is very cool and does a really good job of moving its focus quickly from speaker to speaker. The mic is excellent. It's easy to set up, and once it's plugged into USB it basically operates itself. It's fairly portable to move around to different meeting rooms. Plus, it's cute (it hoots!).\n\nCaveat: if you don't use a good, modern video conferencing platform you might be disappointed with how that platform displays the video from the Owl -- you need a nice wide window to fit the 360 degree view of the room. So use a good conferencing platform (we switched to one of the popular free ones and it's great).", "Excellent microphone\nvery poor speaker.....very low volume can barely be heard by every one in the room, only the one just beside it can hear it weekly, ended up using another speaker with it\nsent an email requesting support , they never responded\nyou should have iOs app to control the zooming on speaker, android app doe snot work", "Works great.  Buying more", "We really want to like the owl but it's having mixed reactions around the office. Sound quality is great in Google meet. Picture quality is a bit grainy overall and has issues with the windows in our conference room. Speaker volume just isn't as loud as we'd like. And when used with our uberconference account, sound quality really suffers.\n\nUpdate after a few months - audio quality has been getting worse. There's no background noise reduction and sounds like sirens that are 4 stories away deafen meeting attendees.", "I work for a company with about 26K employees, where infrastructure is pretty locked down but we realize that \"digital is coming\" and that we have to be more flexible. My review is really for the corporate IT department trying to figure out what the heck this thing is, is it a security risk, and where do we go from here.\n\nFirst, we wanted to know that this can be used in fully stand alone mode-- USB only-- as a webcam. It can. Internet is not absolutely required, it does work with Pixelbook and Chromebooks, it does work with Windows 10 with no additional manual driver loads required.\n\nIT does do what it claims, scanning the room, identifying humans, making them the center of the video when they are speaking as you would expect from a very large, very expensive video conferencing system. The video quality was \"good\" but I wouldn't call it exceptional.\n\nNext: Firmware updates. Yes it does require some kind of wifi based internet connection and a smart phone app to initiate firmware updates. At this point we have users using their smart phone as a mobile hotspot to manage firmware updates. We don't allow unauthenticated devices without MDM on our wireless network today, so this was the most logical short term workaround.\n\nNext: Can it be secured? Not really. I thought it was running Android, haven't been able to confirm what OS is on it.\n\nFinally: The Registration: This is probably the part that, at first was the most concerning from a corporate IT perspective. It has its own cloud based utilization/ status/ statistics gathering program that allows anyone with a corporate email address who registers a unit to see all of the other units in the environment. I discovered that we had two other units registered. In reality a person could register the unit on a personal email account and we'd never know about it, etc. This is the murky part that we haven't fully settled in on.\n\nAs of now the units are still allowed for use and we haven't made any clear conclusions on starting up an IoT type dedicated SSID, though this is not the only product driving that kind of decision it's certainly one of them.\n\nThe device does accomplish it's goal of making a remote worker feel more part of the team and for that, there were few to no other prefect alternatives.", "The Owl is one of my favorite devices ever.  It is transformational to meet with a group of people and be able to see each one of them face to face.", "Absolutely awesome piece of equipment for our company. We use the Meeting Owl to hold sales meetings in two different cities and they work great. We use them with Office Skype and we are very satisfied. We have tried numerous other methods without this level of success.", "Camera is great sound and voice are ok", "Easy set up and worried perfectly in our small conference room", "Bought this for our stand up meetings, amazing concept and adheres to the present person speaking. Really impressive! Price point is definitely on the higher end, but will help when you have 20+ team members and majority being remote dialing in.", "Very high quality, I recommend it!", "Video is very good. A solid product. The quick recognition of who is speaking is impressive. The only thing that prevents it from getting 5 stars is the audio. We are finding it is still better to dial in to a meeting and use a conference room phone instead of the Owl's integrated microphone and speakers.", "The meeting owl was exactly what we were looking for.  We were tired of attaching a webcam to our conference room displays.  The webcams were never where we wanted them, and they were exactly as Owl Labs explains them in their demos.  You get the birdseye view, and it is never ideal.  The Owl can be positioned anywhere, and the quality is sufficient for small/medium conference spaces.", "This device is awesome. It took a little while before the cameras would shift to the speaker fast enough, but once the AI figured the room out, it was good. What a wonderful, useful and cost effective solution.", "Company support and sales rep experience not great.  I bought a system about a month ago and asked if they will ahve a new upgraded camera system.  Thye did not say anything and now they have Pro systems.  My Logitech $50 camera quality is better than this $750 system.", "We tried many different ways to record the audio of the meeting. Local, remote, cloud, but none is a good quality.\nThe audio quality is fair enough to listen to people during the meeting but we were expecting very good recording quality for speech recognition. This is not the case.", "I like it very much. I bought one. We tried at the office and then bought other four.\nVery satisfied.", "Would like option to turn off noise cancellation to test if audio pickup improves", "It's working very well for our needs. We use it with Zoom.", "I love this product. It's difficult to describe without using it, but\n\nI work in Cambridge and company HQ is in Milan. We use the owl multiple times a week where there are many people in both offices and the Owl's panning to the speaker makes me feel much more like I'm there. It's not a replacement for in-person meetings, but when you know the people on the other side it makes remote meetings nearly as productive as when we're in the same location.\n\nI was reminded of how good Owl is when I had to conference call with a local (I'm in Cambridge, MA) university group who was using a laptop camera. It was awful. I couldn't see hand gestures, I had to figure out who was speaking based on their voice (more difficult when I'm less familiar and it's a large group). It made me really appreciate the owl.\n\nI can't go back. I won't go back.", "We use the Owl with our Zoom account.  Audio and video quality are good and it is easy to use.  Plus, people find the owl appearance fun.", "Cool great for video conference with multiple people in the room.  Although people do get a little more shy about speaking up when they see their picture on the video screen.  The microphone and audio is barley ok.  It will pick up the drone of the HVAC system and amplify it that has created extra noise and feedback before.  Also one of the units if you touching some of the wires it decides to reset itself and we lose about 60 seconds.  We have switched back to just a Jabra 510 in a USB for Audio which works like a champ and is preffered by most people.", "I was looking to buy a system that was compact yet powerful and would be helpful with our large team meetings in countries all over Central and Eastern Europe.  The Meeting Owl met every standard that we were looking for and more.  We tested one owl for a month then bought 13 more for each of our teams and it has impacted our online meeting in a very positive way.", "I've been a regular user of Conference equipment which is positioned under or over the TVs, where it works well you end up with a cluster of people at the far end, who you can't always see or hear (relying on additional mics etc).\n\nThe owl uses a 360 degree view, which shows the entire room, and a adaptive view, which splits the feed to whoever is talking. It works really well.\n\nPositives;\n\nYou get a more immersive feeling of people in a room, and a better focus on the person who is speaking\nBecause its in the middle the audio pickup is good.\nAs a speaker it works quite well.\nThe whole room is view can be useful.\n\nNegatives\n\nThe unit takes a while to start its video feed\nAs its in the middle you need to run a long cable back to the PC, which in my case as been back to the TV.\nI can't control whether I want the whole room in view or not.\nThe overall quality is adequate but not as good as others.\nIt sometimes takes time to focus on a speaker, so you can't see them for 10-20 seconds.\nNo remote viewer control\nYou get the sides of peoples faces as they're facing a fixed TV !\nThe wifi app is useful, but more complex than expected to setup. Its a shame more wifi features couldn't be leveraged\n\nSummary\n\nIt's certainly more immersive than a single POV, and as such we're still testing the water, but we enjoy the two we now have.", "These things are really impressive. I haven't seen any other product that does as good a job of making remote workers feel like they're in the room. The video gives a much more natural impression of seeing everyone than a fixed side view or even each person in the room having their own camera. It's especially impressive that it works well in tiny rooms as well as moderately sized rooms. At large sizes (> 12 feet from the owl) you run into trouble being too far from the mic.", "This thing is perfect for a small/medium conference table.  The magic is all in the 360 camera and the voice tracking.  It really does do what they say; it tracks who is talking and tracks the camera to their part of the view.  It also does a remarkable job of keeping track of multiple talkers in a split pane view on the bottom, all the while maintaining the panorama on the top.\n\nPlus, it takes no installation on user computers; it behaves just like any other USB device.\n\nAnd those eyes... everyone is charmed by the eyes.", "We have group conference calls all the time.  While there are many Web conferencing apps available on the market, the Owl adds a new dimension to \"virtual presence\" bringing a very strong interaction among participating audiences.  Very nice product and would recommend.", "I bought the MO after having articles forwarded to me from (2) different people in the same day about it and then gettting inundated with social media ads... so good news for the Meeting Owl marketing team, your marketing worked.\n\nWe do morning \"Huddles\" where we have approximately 20 people in one room and a few other people remotely video conferencing in.  We use mainly Chrome OS with Zoom running in a web browser.  Our normal setup is a wide view camera on the top of a TV at one end of the room.  The room is fairly large, approximately 25-30 feet long and 15 feet wide.\n\nWe tested it with a huddle this morning and overall it worked well -- some takeaways so far:\n\n* It definitely has a \"cool\" factor -- people found themselves staring at the screen to see if it noticed they were speaking... we dubbed it \"Witchcraft\" :)\n\n* The speed at which is detects who is speaking can vary -- sometimes it picks them up right away, sometimes it is a little slower to respond.  My guess is it is trying to decipher between someone making rustling noises with paper (ie: not important sounds) vs. important sounds like speaking.\n\n* Our room is large -- the remote users noted that the audio was similar to the high end video conference microphone we normally used -- which was an original concern of mine.\n\n* Since our room is so large, one comment is that the people tend to have a lot of \"white space\" around them -- it would be nice if the Owl could zoom in on them, even digitally, to make them look larger... possibly there could be a setting for the type of meeting (small/medium/large room and if people are sitting or standing, or distance most people are from camera, etc).  When sitting I don't think this would be as much an issue as when we stand for our huddles.  I'm not sure if the resolution of the camera currently is high enough to support this.\n\n* The remote users noted it was an improvement to be able to see the face of the person speaking.  Normally they have to guess who is speaking based upon recognizing the voice.\n\n* We had a few minor glitches... there was one situation where my body was directly on a split and MO would not center on me.  I could see my left and right arms but the middle of my body was on the camera split.  I made sure to talk directly at it was not able to pick up.\n\n* The full room view is not very useful when having a large conference (huddle) type setup -- the remote users considered it more \"gimmicky\" and not effective as it was too small.  It also takes up the screen real-estate and so the direct shots of people are smaller.  Two options: A) It would be nice to have the option in the app to turn that feature off.  B) It would be cool if it could  \"auto turn off\" if someone within the same room was not speaking.  For example if only a remote person was speaking, show the full room, but once someone within the room is speaking  then show only the large views of people (and get rid of the panorama) as it is not as relevant.  This may be tough as you would have to figure out how MO could determine the difference between a speaker and the TV [Maybe the app would allow defining the location of the TV in the setup to aid MO in this].\n\n* Along with having an app to change settings -- I may have a number of staff using the device and not be connected to MO for settings.  It would be cool to have mini QR code cards (think index card type things) that we could hold up to the MO camera to change settings.  If my team wanted to turn the Panorama on/off, they could just hold up a QR code to the MO and it would change the setting instantly.  We don't want people fumbling with their phones or having to \"connect\" it if they have not already.  [Feel free to send me a free MO if you use that idea LOL]\n\n* One unintended side effect: The MO makes me much more aware of the bald spot on the back of my head... I can now see it when I look at the TV. :)", "Great Product", "Excellent product, works great for our multi-office meetings. We even send them to clients (with a return label of course!) for multi-person onboardings. Picture quality is great, sound quality is great. Simple and easy to set up and use with Zoom!", "Ideal to place in the middle of a small to midsize conference table. To my knowledge, the camera doesn\u2019t zoom, so be aware of that if your meetings require this feature. However, the fact that it knows who is talking and flips the camera over to them is pretty slick. We used this routinely on video conferences with up to 10 people in our conference room. We have recommended the OWL several times to others after they saw us using it.", "My company purchased the Owl a month ago. Yesterday, I participated in a meeting remotely. Most of the participants were in a conference room, while a few of us participated via webex. It felt like I was in the meeting room! I could see everyone around the conference room table, and the device highlights the person speaking. This will save a lot of money on travel expenses. I only wish it was a little smaller so we could travel with it more easily. It fits in a carry-on, but the box is about the size of a shoe box and takes up a fair amount of space. Overall, this is a great product and works well for distributed teams.", "Just got my Meeting Owl in the mail yesterday. I ordered it so long ago I can't actually remember when I did it but it was sometime last summer when they were promoting the heck out of it. It looked cool so I ordered one to try for my real estate business. Unfortunately it took over 6 months to get here and I had already bought another webcam.\n\nNonetheless, I tried it out today in a meeting with some colleagues. We all agreed the constant jumping around as it tries to figure out who is talking is distracting.  One of our team on the far end said it made it impossible to concentrate on what people were saying because she was fixated on watching the camera move around. Maybe it's because we have been using a different camera and are used to a steady view but the experience wasn't what we expected. We'll be going back to our old camera for now.", "We use Microsoft Teams for our internal meetings, and Zoom for external meetings. From day one OWL has been a big disappointment, Keep away from this product, it\u2019s buggy and long way to go before it get to where the company wants the product to be, very disappointed.", "Wonderful and powerfull tool!!!", "Lo pr\u00e1ctico, peque\u00f1o y funcional", "The Owl works as advertised, simply setup (plug in one USB port), and provides a great immersive experience for remote meeting attendees.  We liked it so well we bought three more :)", "Best product in the market for 360 and follow the speaker. Would buy it again", "Love our Owl.  It works well for our small team to connect with our remote employees and clients.  Sound and picture quality are great.  We normally can't hear well with other solutions when on video conferences, but with our Owl, we actually needed to turn down the volume a bit!  :)", "So far this is the best video conferencing equipment we have ever used.  It is a bit slow to pick up new voices sometimes.  It really allows good visuals and good microphones so all can fully participate without frustration. It is pricey but there are not many good options less pricey.", "We\u2019ve used the Owl Leora about 5 months. Very reliable and clear camera. The speaker is great. Also, I like the portability of it as we move it from meeting room to meeting room. I actually took it out of town to a remote board meeting. Worked great. Since we show some smaller products during our presentations, I love that we can move the Owl clofser to the presenter versus having to use ha zoom thingy.

Cell phones take amazing photos these days, but they can run 10x the cost of this little camera.  You get to hold your photo in your hand almost immediately, rather than just having another in your online stash.  It takes you back to the old Polaroid days.", "We LOVE that this camera prints photo stickers in under 30 seconds (that don't need to be flapped around or left to develop like the Polaroids I saw a couple years ago). It arrived charged enough for us to play with it right out of the box and comes with 10 photo sheets. We immediately tested it by taking a photo of our dog before getting pics for our youngest of her with each of her three family members. She loved being able to peel the backing off and stick them right on her play kitchen. We are pleased with the photo quality and the auto-flash (which turned on or didn't depending on which way relative to the window we faced the camera). And I'm enjoying this incredible combination of a blast from the past (I'm a 90s kid) and modern technology.\nThis is great for people who love gadgets, families, high schoolers, and teachers who need to print photos of kids for cubbies and the like. It would also be an awesome way to create personalized party favors for guests - just snap a photo of the birthday kid and the guest and hand the guest the printout!\nYes, the sheets are about $.50 each, but last time I checked, a standard photo printer cost $.30-.50 to print a photo. That doesn't provide instant gratification, it doesn't include a sticker backing, and it isn't available on the go no matter where you are.\nSome tips:\n-The CLIQ+ offers more features but it also uploads your photos to Canon (and Canon has rights to them!), or at least can based on the user agreement. This one is not connected to anything via Bluetooth or Wifi.\n-The viewfinder is just slightly off-center from what prints. There's a barely visible guide in there, so look for that before framing your subjects.\n-It's super easy to press the shutter button, so be careful! I accidentally got a sideways picture of my staircase.", "This little camera is great for novelty situations, but isn't really a viable option for those who want great pictures. The paper isn't cheap and the picture quality is really lacking. In fact, I would say the traditional Polaroids are better quality than these are.  Perhaps the long term fading isn't quite the same, but I wasn't real impressed with this camera.  If you want to have the assurance that your pictures aren't floating around cyberspace, or the fun of seeing them printed out instantly, it could be worth it.  If you are looking for high quality instant photos, I don't think you this will work for you.", "Great little camera!", "On the surface this might look like a great stocking stuffer. But the reality in execution is anything but.. Yes this is a digital camera that will write images to an SD card (not included). BUT - the camera will not take a picture unless you have the Zink paper loaded in. Every button push prints out a photo at a cost of .50 per shutter activation. If you're thinking this might be a fun toy for a kid, think again. Printing is not optional.\n\nThe 5 megapixel sensor is also very low quality, producing images that remind me of the front sensor one might see on a cheap imported smartphone. Even moderately lit scenes produce lots of noise in dark areas on the digital image, and the printed images are washed out and bland.\n\nWhat's worse is that despite having a printer on board it can't connect up to anything else. There's no bluetooth for printing out smartphone photographs, and all its onboard USB connection does is charge the camera.\n\nIn short this is not worth the purchase. The $160 step up from this one (called the Cliq+) might be worth considering given that it does allow printing from other devices and includes a flash that this device lacks.", "I know this camera has a lot of negative reviews, but I didn't have any issues. It worked perfectly for me. The picture is a perfct wallet size (2inx3in), and while they aren't as clear or as detailed at digital I didn't expect them to be. For a polaroid camera they were great, and my kiddos seem to love it!", "This product is suppose to bring the polaroid style with the digital camera. I mean it is a decent size and doesn't come with a carrying case but it does come with a wrist band. It also comes with 10 blank picture cards. When I took the picture it doesn't give a real indication on when it will print out. It just has light on top which will show that. One of the biggest things about this is the capture button is way too sensitive and once you take the picture you literally can't tell the camera to print or not to print so it will auto print whatever picture it takes. There is a small mirror in the front for selfies. Although for the price you pay for the camera, I really wish you had a screen to really see the picture you are taking since you literally have no idea if the picture looks good or not and it will just print it out. It does have a micro SD slot for you to store the picture. Overall I do not think this is a great camera to have. It had decent quality picture if you have a steady hand in my opinion. I do think this product could use some work and give you a bit more features for the price you pay.", "Camera with poor image quality will not enjoy handling it.  Do not waste your money buying this product.  Poor Image Quality", "The design is just perfect as it makes it easy to carry around everywhere that you go. It is a stunning camera, too.", "I am obsessed with the look of this red instant print camera. I personally use it a lot to take selfies because they always come out looking so great thanks to this camera!", "I love this camera! It's the right size to fit in your pocket or purse.", "I love how small this instant print camera is that way I can take it with me on all of my trips. All that it needs is the paper, too!", "This camera reminds me of the fun I used to have with Polaroid cameras back in the day. Of course, the size of this camera is a fraction of the size those old cameras were and actually easier to use. However, much like those old Polaroids this camera definitely has its limitations.\n\nThe biggest limitation is that you can only really use it for close-in shots if you want to see any detail, especially considering how small the actual prints are. If you try taking any pics from more than 15' away or so it becomes impossible to see any real detail or identify anyone in the picture.\n\nIt is a great selfie camera and is a lot of fun to use when you are out with friends. The photos paper is pretty expensive though, just like with Polaroids. Just be sure to keep that in mind. If you want to be able to take close-in pics and print them out instantly without having to carry around a separate printer, this is about the best choice out there right now.", "This camera takes not so great photos, but I don't think the point is to have a beautiful perfect picture.  It's on par or slightly better than most of the polaroids Ive taken.  It's compact, although not compared to modern day phones and digital cameras.  Super simple, turn it on, press the button, and it prints, that's about all there is to it.  Refills aren't bad, running about 50 cents per print (2\" x 3\")", "This is such a cute, blue instant print camera! However, apart from its looks, it is also so easy to operate and it produces such quality photos.", "Pretty fun. My young teen likes it.", "I wanted to be able to get a camera that could take decent instant photos to hang or use as a sticker right then and there. With the advent of the digital age, I take lots of pictures, but end up printing very few, so I wanted something I could have fun with here and there.\n\nWhen I got this Canon IVY CLIQ Instant Camera Printer, it was easy to charge using their included cord, and simple to install the included 10-pack of photo paper, which also has the option of using them as an instant sticker. After taking a few pictures in bright light conditions (and a couple in lower light conditions, as well), it quickly became apparent that none of the pictures were going to be good quality. It's bad. I mean, I knew they weren't going to be like digital photos, but I expected at least old-style Polaroid quality, or something similar to that. The colors weren't even close to on-point, details are not distinct at all even when taken up close, and ALL pictures just look like they're...faded/fuzzy, for lack of a better term?\n\nI'm going to let my youngest son play around with the rest of the pictures, but I honestly don't see much point in getting more paper for this. If it can't even print a half-way decent picture anywhere close to the quality that I could get in the 80's with an old Polaroid camera, what's the point? At this price point, there's no value for this at all, not to mention that the paper you need to buy to replenish your meager 10-pack supply isn't cheap, either.\n\nWhile this technically \"works\" and is \"easy to use,\" I expected much, MUCH better from Canon. It's just a junky toy, and you can get far nicer toys at this price. Would not recommend at all, which really bums me out, as I wanted to love this.", "My daughter bought a Fuji Instax camera a couple of years ago. All of her friends have one, too. Any comparisons that I make will be with the Instax. The kids who use the Instax want printed pictures NOW. The quality of the Instax pictures is just so-so, but they get the pictures immediately. The quality of the pictures from the Cliq is just so-so, too. They're a little larger than the Instax ones plus these are stickers if you want to use them that way. You can always leave the sticker backing on them and keep them just as small pictures. This camera is priced about the same as some of the Instax versions, though you can get some models for cheaper. The film prices is about the same, too. The biggest advantage that I see with this over the Instax is the size of the camera. My daughter likes to take her Instax with her, but the size is cumbersome. The Cliq is about the size of a cell phone and can fit in your pocket or purse without any issues. A lot of times my daughter leaves her Instax at home because she doesn't want to deal with it. So if you're considering getting an instant print camera and know that the picture quality isn't going to be very high, then I think this camera is a serious contender.", "**See my review of the IVY Cliq+ for a much better alternative.**\n\nThe IVY Cliq is a fixed-focus camera that takes a 5 megapixel digital photograph and then immediately prints it out on proprietary, tiny photo paper that can also be used as a sticker. It's Canon's alternative to the popular Instax toy \"cameras.\"\n\nFirst, the positives. The photos printed quickly, and did not bleed or run at all. The form factor is good, and the build quality feels solid. The prints are slightly larger than with an Instax, and the camera has an SD card slot.\n\nNow, for the negatives. First and foremost, this takes terrible photos. Color rendition was - in some cases - radically off. Even when the colors weren't terrible, they were often washed out. No one expects high resolution from a fixed-focus camera, but the image quality was far below what I would expect for a $100 device. It's hard to tell if the issue is with the camera itself, or with the ZINK paper (which I suspect is the more likely culprit).\n\nIn addition, it is far too easy to accidentally snap a picture, which not only means wasting paper, it also means having to wait for that photo to print before you can take the shot you want. Even if it meant a higher price, a MUCH better option would be a camera with a screen that allows you to choose which photos you want to print.\n\nAt half the price this might be a fun toy to give to a young person wanting to decorate their notebooks and their lockers with oddly-shaded photos of friends. You might also use it when packing for a move or storage, to take a picture of the contents of a box and then slap that picture on the lid.\n\nNonetheless, in a world where nearly everyone shopping for this product has a phone that take much, much better photos, it's hard to find a niche for a product that performs this poorly.", "This is an awesome camera.  It is great that you can click a photo and then print from your camera.  The quality of the pic is nice.  It is great to use to photos for a scrape book or a photo album...  The yellow is awesome.  You will be able to find it anywhere.  A must have...", "As my screen name indicates I am a career professional photographer, published in numerous newspapers and magazines. Why would I have the slightest interest in this camera? Because it has a purpose, and sadly, based on reading several reviews it appears there are too many expectations for it to be something it was never intended to be.\n\nPICTURE QUALITY\n\nI have taught photo workshops for 13 years. One of my strongest beliefs is that cameras don't take pictures, people do. Why even mention that this has a fixed focus lens or that it is rated as 5 megapixels? Neither is important. More megapixels don't make better pictures, and what this camera has is more than capable of producing the 2x3 inch pictures it's intended to make. Those photo stickers ARE the final result, the user will never make poster size enlargements to warrant needing any higher resolution. And taking into consideration the intended user of this camera, not being able to change the fixed focus lens is actually an advantage.\n\nCOMPARISON TO SMARTPHONES\n\nAgain, there are comments totally missing the point of the Cliq. Sure everyone has a smartphone and sure most of those have impressive cameras, and sure you can take a picture then take it home and edit it and print out a nice full page image on glossy photo paper using a couple of dollars worth of ink and paper. But you can't use a smartphone to snap a pic of your BFF making a silly face at you between classes and instantly print out a couple of stickers you both can put on your locker door. Will those pics look like the cover of Rolling Stone? No, and who cares - if you don't get that you're not the right person to own this camera anyway.\n\nFEATURES\n\nMy opinion is who cares if it has a high resolution viewfinder or lacks a bunch of knobs and dials like a $600 Canon Powershot G7x Mark II, it's a waste of time trying to compare them, so I won't.\n\nHERE\u2019S WHAT YOU WANT TO KNOW\n\nHere are my own observations based on the hands-on facts of actually using it\n\n1. The look, feel and quality of the camera are what you expect from a name brand like Canon, it does not feel cheap or toylike.\n\n2. The number of well-labeled buttons and controls is minimal - a power switch that you have to hold down for a few seconds to prevent turning it on accidentally, the shutter button, a button to select picture size and a reprint button. Someone mentioned that they kept accidentally pressing the shutter button by mistake.  Of course that's user error, but the simple answer is that they shouldn't leave the camera turned on between uses, if the power switch is properly turned off between uses it is impossible to accidentally press the shutter button.\n\n3. There is absolutely nothing technical or complicated about it.  That's the way it is designed and in my opinion that makes it perfect for non-techies.\n\n4. There is no cover on the lens to break or lose.  There is a tiny mirror next to the lens for selfies.  Both are advantages.\n\n5. A short charging cable is included but not a charger. They assume you already have one, but I think they are wrong.  Someone who buys this thing is probably not a high tech person who has a drawer full of spare chargers.\n\n6. The instruction sheet is mostly illustrations and very simplistic, another bad assumption on Canon's part.  Someone who gets this camera may have never seen one before in their life. They need to do a better job explaining what it is and give more fun examples of how to use it.\n\n7. People who grew up using cameras and phones with LCD viewfinder screens will be lost and think this camera is impossible to use without one.  Try to remember that for 100 years people took family photos with simple box cameras that had only one button and no viewfinder screen.  Also remember that with those cameras, just like this one, you couldn't see your pictures until after you waited a week while they were \"developed\" and every picture you took (good or bad) got printed and you paid for each of them regardless if they turned out good.  That retro vibe is one of the cool endearing qualities Canon has brought back here in a world of hurry up, instant gratification and the need for everything to be \"perfect\".\n\n8. This camera uses Zink film, something created by Polaroid almost 30 years ago and is what most of the instant cameras made by Polaroid are using even today.  It is reasonably priced and universally available.  Zink has the advantage of being smudge-proof, water-resistant, and tear-resistant and has a sticky back for instant fun.  It's not designed for serious photography and no one will ever say it's the best film ever.  The limitation with this camera is not the lens or megapixels, it is the Zink film itself.  Now that being said, are the pictures terrible?  No, in fact they surprised me with their color saturation and sharpness.  The first one I took was a closeup of my cat backlit against a bright sunny window, a challenge for any camera, and it turned out surprisingly well. My second shot was of the flowers on my patio table, the colors are accurate, clear and the photo is sharp even though I was only about two feet away.  I included samples of these because seeing real photos is better than reading someone's opinion. Keep in mind these pictures happen in an  instant and you never have to buy expensive printer ink.\n\n9. You may be shocked that the rated battery life is only 25 photos per charge.  There are two things to keep in mind.  One is that this camera prints every picture you take so you\u2019re not going to be snapping dozens of the same shot over and over.  It takes only a speedy one minute to print each picture (faster than any other way I know of to get a decent color photo) and each pak of Zink paper is only 10 sheets.  You can buy large economy sizes but the camera itself only holds 10 at a time. The other thing is the printing process uses heat, which uses up battery life quickly, so remember to turn the power switch off when not actually taking photos, which will also assure that your finger won't accidentally press the shutter button by mistake.  This is a specialized camera so it won\u2019t be your one and only everyday travel camera but rather it will be the one to use for those times when you really want to make instant photo prints, like to use as a refrigerator sticky \"magnet\" of your kids, pets or travels.\n\nTHE FAIRYTALE THAT THESE PICTURES ARE EXPENSIVE\n\nOver and over I keep seeing the untrue statement being made that Zink paper is expensive and therefore this camera is too expensive to use.  The reality of analyzing that starts with the simple fact that these days only about 5% of people who take pictures for personal use make color prints of them, which probably explains why due to inexperience they have no frame of reference how much it costs for photo prints.  I called a couple of photo centers in town and was told that they charge an average of 49 cents and up.  Mail order places cost even more after postage.  The TOTAL cost of printing a photo at home considering paper, ink, ink waste, etc. can start at about 50 cents and go as high as two dollars for the typical common size.  Now compare that to a Zink photo printed on a Canon camera, which requires zero ink (get it, Zink means Zero Ink).  Each print costs 50 cents and you only pay for the pictures you actually take. .  But what everyone is missing is that every other method of printing requires taking your memory card (or film) somewhere and waiting for it to be printed, none of them produce a full color photograph a few seconds after you take it so you can share it and enjoy it.  The bottom line is that comparing this camera to anything else and saying that it is \u201cexpensive\u201d simply doesn\u2019t make sense.\n\nIS IT A TOY\n\nNo it is definitely not a toy, but neither is it a precision photojournalist's instrument either. It's basically what our parents and grandparents used to call a box camera, and no one ever considered those to be toys. I would call it a fun cam, designed and intended for fun loving people, whether they be pre-teens, millennials or Golden Agers - someone who just wants to capture and share a moment with friends and family, who isn't going to take a magnifying glass out and whine that the picture is a little soft or not perfectly exposed. It's the Polaroid camera for today's world, and by the way for those with short memories those old Polaroids were constantly criticized for their so-called poor picture quality yet these days some of those instant photos are hanging in galleries and museums.\n\nMY PROFESSIONAL OPINION\n\nIf you don't understand what this camera is, don't buy it. If you're a pixel peeper or camera snob or thinks it will replace your smartphone or compact travel camera, you don't get it and that's all right. It's not for you. Me, I'm having a ton of fun with it and I compliment Canon on helping to bring back the giggles of instant photography.", "This is a pretty cool little camera. The photo quality is not exceptional, but being able to instantly have a real picture is pretty cool. Photo paper is really expensive so you definitely need to pick your shots. I wanted to let me kids use this, but would be blowing through money.", "I use this camera all the time, especially for selfies. It comes with both a mirror and an auto flash which really helps make sure that all of my selfies come out looking amazing. I also really like the color of my camera. I have gotten so many compliments for it, too!", "I've used this camera for a few weeks now, it's nothing crazy to rave about, but for the idea it's not bad.\n\nFirst off, the camera is made of all plastic and feels cheaply made, so I wouldn't rate it too highly in the durability department.  It prints your pictures instantly and as a note, just like the old polaroid cameras, once you take a picture, you have to wait for it to finish printing before you can take another picture.  Every picture you take gets stored on an SD card if you insert it, but the picture quality stored on the SD card is comparable to what my cellphone ten years ago took.  The picture is not crystal clear, but you can still tell what the picture is of.  On the back of the camera you have a button where you can choose to take a picture that is 2\"x3\" or 2\"x2\".  I'm not sure what the purpose of the 2x2 picture is since it prints on the paper as a 2x2 picture with a blank white one inch bar on the right.  On the front of the camera is a little mirror that is pretty accurate at showing you what you're taking a picture of if you plan on taking selfies... good on Canon for that!\nThe camera uses \"zero ink\" paper, which doesn't print out amazing quality pictures, and in my experience, printed pictures tend to fade after some time.\nCompared to the polaroid zip or a lifeprint printer, the quality of photos are basically the same.  However, if I had to pick a winner in the novelty department in this case I would give it to Lifeprint.  The zip and lifeprint printers need to be connected to a phone app, but who doesn't carry their phone around with them anyway.  I was in the market for this kind of printer/camera because I like to use the printer to print pictures on small paper that can be stuck to an album and use this specifically for scrapbooking.\nAll in all, I wouldn't recommend this camera unless you had your heart set on taking pictures and having them print on the spot.  You'd find better results however, using your cellphone, picking (And editing if you wish) and printing using either the Lifeprint printer or the Polaroid Zip.", "It is so easy to take selfies with this instant print camera thanks to the mirror and they turn out looking good because of the auto flash.", "As the current fad of 'polaroid' style cameras goes, I'll admit that so far this one has the best picture quality of any I've seen. I still wish they'd figured out a way to put a flash on these darn things, though. I tested it in my kitchen, taking pictures of my pets, and the photos were very yellow-toned. It's definitely not my kitchen lighting, because I have taken plenty of photos in there that didn't have that coloring, though I suppose the camera could be picking up on the colors of the kitchen itself (greens and yellowish greens) or even the dogs (both of whom are blonde colored).\n\nOther than the off tones of the pictures, for the price of the photo paper ($25 for 50 sheets) I would have really hoped that there would be an option to choose whether or not to print a picture that you take. But nope, the moment you click that button, you've made that 50 cent decision.\n\nHowever, the size of this camera is great considering what it does, and the actual printed photos (which are wallet size - 2x3\") vs. a true polaroid style, are great. I would recommend this over other polaroid-style cameras that I've tried out the past year or two, for sure...IF you just really want a camera that prints automatically. Otherwise I'd say wait a bit and see if they perfect this technology a bit more.", "I got this for my 7 year old and she loves it. She has a couple friends who has cameras like this and wanted one so badly for herself.\nThe color of the camera is deep and beautiful.\nIt takes pics well. Just have to learn to hold it there for a second after you hit the button as it has like a delay flash. My 6 year old kept trying to use it and would move right away and get blurry pics.\nThey print quickly, look good amd my kid loves sticking them all over her room.\nLoading photo paper is easy, just wish that part was cheaper.", "I am a professional photographer who has owned multiple Canon DSLRs and point-and-shoots, and photo opportunities pop up in my head every day. In other words, I love photography and have been taking a lot of casual and professional photos. The old Polaroid instant cameras have a place deep in my heart.\n\nHISTORY BEHIND INSTANT CAMERAS\nOver the years, as digital cameras proliferated (especially with smartphones), prints had become less and less common. This had forced Polaroid, one of the pioneers of photo prints, and Kodak to exit the film (and in some cases, the camera) industry. More and more photos were casually taken and shared on social media, and the value of any one particular photo was no longer as strong as it used to be.\n\nPolaroid instant cameras (a device with a camera and built-in printer) were no more when they transitioned to a digital-only camera maker, but they have had such a cult following, instant photos were still popular among many. My wife still very much cherishes printed photos carefully laid out in photo albums, and I must agree -- flipping through them evokes a much more timeless, nostalgic feeling than scrolling through digital photos.\n\nIronically, instant photo printers have been making a comeback with Fujifilm Instax (the current leader by number of sales -- as much as over 8 million camera units sold in 2018), Polaroid, and Kodak, a trend set by influencers and social media enthusiasts. Canon decided to cash in on that trend with its IVY CLIQ cameras -- its first instant one -- although quite late to the party. Nonetheless, the company has a lot of experience making cameras. After all, they are the leader in the DSLR space, but in recent years, they have seemed to play catch up to their competition (looking at Sony and Nikon's successes up until just a year ago).\n\nThe IVY CLIQ (and its higher-end CLIQ+ sibling), unfortunately, do not live up to Canon's quality in terms of image quality or prints. That is sad, but at the price they are being sold at, one should not expect professional prints, but more as fun and simple cameras. The prints, however, are not as good as the old Polaroid instant cameras or the Fujifilm Instax.\n\nPROS\n- Fun and simple to use (there's no screen to flip through. Just point, shoot, and save or print)\n- Instant photo printing (takes about 50 secs)\n- Portable and compact\n- Wide 25.4mm lens is fast at f/2.2\n- 5 megapixel (MP) sensor (CLIQ+ has 8 MP)\n- Built-in flash\n- Selfie mirror (CLIQ+ version also includes an LED ring flash around the lens for taking better portraits by illuminating the face more softly and adding tasty catch lights to your eyes)\n- Prints provide a nostalgic, tangible feeling that digital photos lack nowadays\n- Can peel the print's adhesive backing, turning them into stickers (Peel-and-stick)\n- Optical viewfinder to frame photos with before taking the shot\n- Photos can be saved onto a microSD memory card\n- Auto exposure and auto focus\n- Standard microUSB cable charging\n- Reprint button to print another copy of the previous photo\n- Holds up to 10 sheets of Zink film paper. They are smudge-proof, tear-free, and water-resistant (don't dunk them into water though!)\n- 50-pack of Canon Zink paper costs $25, 20-pack is $10 ($0.5/print)\n- 2x2 and 2x3 layout printing options (number of frames per print)\n- 10 Zink sheets included (2x3)\n- No bulky instruction manual is included, minimizing trash and paper waste\n- Long battery life and charged quickly\n\nThe CLIQ does NOT have Bluetooth. As such, this model does NOT have the below functions that the CLIQ+ provides:\n- View on/share from your smartphone\n- Print any photo from your smartphone with the Canon Mini Print app. The same app can also print to Canon's stand-alone IVY printer\n- Use your smartphone as a remote control for group photos\n- Canon Mini Print app can be used to add filters, photo frames, and text to the photos before printing\n\nCONS\n- Printing speed can be considered slow at about 50 secs\n- Canon's Zink film does not print as well as Fujifilm's in regards to colors and resolution (the latter has several years of experience)\n- Photo quality taken by the CLIQ/CLIQ+ camera are not that great\n- Prints are mediocre, but turn out a bit better when the photo was originally taken with a smartphone\n- No bulky instruction manual is included. You have to download a copy from Canon's website\n- Camera will not take photos directly to the microSD card without any film in it. (For better photos, just use your smartphone anyway)\n\nTIPS and NOTES\n- CLIQ and CLIQ+ are known in Europe as the Zoemini C and S, respectively\n- Photos taken in good lighting will almost always come out better than ones taken in darker areas\n- Take photos with your smartphone (they are of better quality), then print to the CLIQ+ with the Canon Mini Print app for better print quality\n\nOverall, I am disappointed as a photographer who values quality. The images taken by the CLIQ/CLIQ+ cameras are mediocre, and the prints are a bit laughable. However, for instant, fun, simple prints, these are GREAT cameras to take with you on the road -- nothing beats taking silly photos with your family, print them, and instantly be able to use them as stickers or keep them for memories. Decades down the road, being able to hold this PRINTED photo of your family vacation... one that your children touched when they were young... will have a MUCH deeper connection than simply looking at the same photo on a screen.\n\nCanon's first array into the instant photo printer market is a nice try, but they have some catching up to do with Fujifilm.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please click the \"Yes/Helpful\" button below to encourage me to write more. Thank you!", "This Canon Instant Camera with Printer is SO fun to use! It is extremely compact and can fit into a pocket or small clutch. The yellow color is very bright and stylish. One of my favorite things about this camera is that it flashes bright lights as it prints the picture. My main reason for reducing 1 star is that the pictures do not come out nearly as bright as it shows they do in the product description. They have a cool vintage look, however, do not look like a picture you took with your phone at all. The paper is easy to load and the pictures print quite quickly. This is a super fun gift for anyone, especially pre-teens and teens, but is enjoyed by college kids and adults!", "This instant print camera is especially great for selfies thanks to the mirror that it comes with.", "I got this camera as a birthday gift and I am honestly so obsessed with it. It is so small and skinny so I can carry it around with me everywhere. It also takes solid pictures. I am pretty happy with the prints as well.", "I'm a huge fan of physical pictures, especially when you can get them seconds after pressing the shutter. The Canon IVY Cliq camera is using a technology called Zink and it stands for \"zero ink\".  There is no ink really storing inside the camera itself.  The camera itself is readily easy to operate.  You turn on the camera, you aim, then fire,  then it prints.  The package came with 10 Zink papers for you to try and you can get more from Amazon when you need it.  There is MicroSD card slot available to you, you could put a card in and it will store the image that you took to the card and you can view them on your computer.\n\nUnfortunately, I'm not bowled over by the image quality from Zink-based cars and printers.  The color and gradients of brightness are not that great.  The images have a very heavy mid-tone bias that makes them feel like something from the past, and not in a good way.\n\nIf you are looking for an easy way to share those selfies or group portraits in the real world, you should get the Canon IVY Cliq camera.", "I had the opportunity to try out this Canon CLIQ camera as part of the Amazon Vine program and it fulfills a function unseen since the days of Polaroids, but it feels very much like a \"work in progress.\"\n\nHere's the deal - it's a point and click camera that allows you to INSTANTLY PRINT OUT THE PHOTO YOU JUST TOOK!\n\nIs it a nice photo?\n\nWell, no. The resolution is reminiscent of photos taken with flip phones from 15 years ago.  Plus, your choice is either a photo two by three inches, or two by two inches (which is a 2 x 2 photo printed onto 2 x 3 paper.) Not exactly poster sized - or quality.\n\nThe camera charges with the ubiquitous Micro USB cord, and it's a good thing I already had some because the cord that came in the box connected well enough to turn on the amber \"charging\" light, but not nearly well enough to actually charge the camera overnight. I sent an email to Canon telling me the problem and they sent an email back telling me support for this product wasn't available by email and please call 1-800.... blahblahblah. Ain't nobody got time for that!\n\nI connected the camera to the USB that charges my kindle every night and by the next morning I had the reassuring green \"charged\" light lit. We loaded it with paper and took a picture. Out came the less than scintillating 2x3 photo. The camera is made of a flimsy plastic, by the way, and feels as if it would fly into a gazzillion pieces any time it were dropped onto anything harder than a pillow.\n\nThis is aimed at people who might think that a \"digital polaroid\" would be a cool thing so if your life is incomplete without low resolution 2x3 photos - your life just got better! For the rest of us.... meh.", "Old-fashioned shareable imaging takes on a new look in Canon\u2019s Instant Camera Printer. A viewfinder image is magically transformed onto a sticker \u00e0la Polaroid-style inkless technology, albeit in a smaller fashion through a digital camera form. There are challenges to this format that mirror users\u2019 experience with the Polaroid models, namely a difficult viewfinder aperture that complicates picture taking range and accuracy. The miniscule viewfinder on the Canon magnifies that problem. Imaging adjustments are only possible by retaking and printing the picture \u2013 you can\u2019t visualize the image prior to printing - a costly endeavor. An image viewing screen would have made this unique camera a more practical tool and less of a novelty. At this price point, for both camera and film, it\u2019s cheap thrills at a high cost.", "Canon has long established a good reputation in photographic equipment.  This camera is mediocre.  Another drawback was that no instruction booklet came with the camera.  The distinguishing feature is that this camera comes with a built in printer that prints very small images.  I can't say I was overly impressed.", "I love the color of this camera, yellow is my daughters favorite color and she was so excited to see the camera was yellow.  It is easy to use and the pictures come out great.  Instant pics are awesome and fun to use.  It is made well and works great.  easy to use.", "The photo paper that this camera needs is so cool as you don't need ink for it and the photos can also be stickers.", "I'm so happy that instant cameras are back. They never should have gone away. Now that nothing is on film anymore pictures are now being held hostage on our phones. I was immediately impressed by the size of the Canon Ivy. The size is reminiscent of cameras from back in the day. It's not bulky. It's easy to use. You can select between two different sizes for your photos (2x3 and 2x2). I took a couple of selfies and nature photos outside, in bright sunlight. None of the pictures came out great. I was really disappointed. The pictures had a grainy quality to them. Bummer. I was really hoping this would replace the my bulky Fuji Instax but it won't. The fuji instant camera may be bulky but it takes way better pictures.", "I didn't really know what to expect from this camera.  It is very thin and light.  It about the same width and height as a normal point and shoot digital camera. (just thinner)  It comes with 10 sheets of Zink (Zero Ink) paper and you can buy more for around 50 cents per sheet.  (2\" x 3\")  You open the door on the back and insert the stack of sheets with the blue alignment sheet face down.  (it tells you how to do this on the packaging for the paper)\n\nYou power the camera on, take a picture and wait.  The LED light blinks about 4 different colors while it is printing.  If you want another copy of that picture, there is another button to press to get more copies.  There is no preview so if you take a picture it is going to print.  The viewfinder has a 'frame' inside of it.  The camera will print whatever is inside of this 'frame' which took a few pictures to get used to.\n\nThe flash comes on sometimes and other times it does not.  The most difficult part for me has been to get the proper exposure.  My pictures come out either too dark or too light most of the time.  That is the biggest issue I have with the camera.  It is not as easy to take a good picture with as a normal point and shoot.\n\nIt is really cool though.  You hear it printing and then it slowly comes right out of the side of the camera!  That is by far the coolest feature. You can put an SD card in the camera to store your pictures as well.\n\nAlso, the Zink paper has a backing that you can peel and then stick.  I had a little trouble getting the backing to come off so if you don't want to use it as a sticker I don't think it will accidentally come off.  I have to use a pocket knife to get my pictures to peel. (just to start it)\n\nPros:\n-Cool factor.  A tiny printer inside of a camera.  Very cool technology.\n-Sticky backed paper.\n-SD card can be used to store images\n-You can print multiple copies if you get a good image\n-Thin and light\n\nCons:\n-Very difficult to get the proper exposure\n-No previews like standard digital cameras\n-2x3 pictures are pretty small\n-Fairly expensive paper for the picture size\n-Not a replacement for a point and shoot camera\n\nIt is obvious that this cannot replace a point and shoot camera.  That being said, it was never supposed to replace a point and shoot camera.  It is a very cool idea and it works ok.  It is amazing to watch it print though.  It reminds me a little of a Polaroid but the Polaroid pictures were probably twice the size of these pictures.\n\nIt is possible to have a lot of fun with this camera.  I gave it three stars because 50% of my pictures were overexposed or underexposed.  It is really not much of a serious camera.  My kid will use this at his birthday party though.  I bet the kids will get a kick out of taking pictures and sticking them to their shirts.", "The prince run about $0.50 each and they are far from perfect. But you will have so much fun with this camera it's totally worth the price.", "It is so simple to get a nice looking print when you use this camera. I love playing around with its functions, too.", "To cut to the chase, the Canon IVY ClIQ is a toy.  It is a large plastic fixed focus camera which is available in cheery colors.  It has an sd card slot and a printer, which uses ZINK 2x3\" film.  There is no shutter or exposure compensation (obviously) no focus, no depth of field.  It is not just an amateur camera, it is a kid's camera.\n\nWhat an unfortunate  way to be exposed to photography.  The colors are way off as is the exposure (well, there is no way to tell how the exposure is until you print, and no way to adjust or compensate).  The printer has a resolution of 314 x 500 ppi, which is about half the resolution of the worst ink jet printer in  our house (and we have some which are much better).\n\nMy daughter is a talented amateur photographer.  She has won some prestigious awards and is a pretty serious amateur.  I thought she would have fun with this, but instead, was pretty frustrated.  For one, the buttons aren't labeled (except for the one which allows you to choose 2x3 or 2x2 prints).  There were a couple of accidental photos, one of the lawn, another just a reprint.  This camera reminded me of how good we have it with a large window on the back of the camera (on most digital cameras) which allows us to to get a really good sense of what we are shooting, but, this is not about photography, it is about selling expensive film, which you will use a lot of if you can not tell how the photo has turned out.  I took several of her, outside (figuring we would have the best shot at getting good exposure, not knowing what iso it was intended to imitate).  I would guess 100-200.  We shot outdoors in the middle of the day, in Hawaii.  That should have been adequate light, and it seems to have been, but in one photo the flesh tones were white (clown white) in another they were red.  The low resolution of the printer ensures that you will never get a good photo.  The only thing which is \"good\" about it is that the film costs about half of what film for the Poleriod costs, but that is color rich film, and the camera has some controls, and the photos are twice the size.  I think this is meant to be a throw away festival camera.  I am surprised that Canon would put their name on it.  Canon makes some good cameras, and we have a photo printer from Canon which is quite good, and about the size of this camera, and it prints at much higher resolution, with more accurate colors, and costs about the same.  In fact, one of my favorite cameras is a little Panasonic Lumix with a Leica zoom lens, which cost about $15 less than this camera  I would say that there is no good reason to get this camera, except that, as my daughter pointed out, it prints stickers.... so maybe you would want to buy it for a 5 year old.  It probably fares better if dropped than the glass lens on my little Panasonic, but that one takes good pictures (and I have no doubt at all that one of the photo printing services would make them into stickers for you if that is what you want.... not instantly, but close).  Actually, if you want instant prints, buy almost any other camera, and the Canon compact photo printer.  It will get you beautiful photos instantly, at a fraction the price.\n\nThis is unquestionably the worst camera I have used since I ordered a miniature \"spy\" camera for $1 from an ad on the back of a comic book when I was a kid.  (That one was also about expensive film, and processing).", "This is a cute instant camera and it has some pros and cons. For the pros, I love the picture quality. The photos come out clear with really good color if you compare them to the Instax Mini by Poloroid. I think the quality of the photos is better. The camera itself is a little more simple than the Instax Mini-cuz they are cute! But the color print of the photo is pretty darn good in the Canon and it\u2019s sticker paper which is pretty neat and you have two size options for pictures on the Canon. I think for traveling, the Canon Cliq is smaller and easier to carry, tho I have a case for the Poloroid that is pretty sweet, the Canon fits into my purse with room to spare. Teens will love this as they do the small Poloroid.\n\nThe Canon Cliq produces really good quality photos with clear detail. For a fun instant camara-I like this. This is a colorful, fun little instant camera with no frills that produces fun, clear sticker pictures. What\u2019s not to like?\n\nAs usual, the cost of the 10 pack of film can be pricey so you have to try and not waste your film. But for fun get togethers, candid pictures you can print right away are very festive and fun.", "All pictures were dark even when pictures were taken outside", "This is a bright, lightweight camera that's basically a point and shoot and print. All you have to do is aim and push the button: The printing happens automatically. The camera comes with a pack of photo paper for 2\" x 3\" pictures, so you'll be able to try it out before investing in more film. When you do, it will run you about 50 cents per picture, which seems reasonable. (Especially if you remember how much we used to spend on film and processing in the pre-digital days.) The picture quality is okay for the purpose, and that purpose is, I'd say, impermanent fun: the photo paper is peel and stick, so these pictures are meant to adorn notebooks and lockers and mirrors, I'd say, not to be passed down to one's grandchildren. This picture will not replace your current point and shoot. It's just a fun party camera that may or may not be worth its price, depending on your priorities.\n\nOne problem with the camera is that it prints anything you take automatically, so if you accidentally press the shutter button you're getting a horrible picture printed out, whether you want it or not. The problem that bothers me more, though, is that it's very hard for me to see the frame in the viewfinder, the lines that demarcate what will print. Against certain backgrounds I can see some of them, usually not all of them. It's pretty annoying. Maybe if I had perfect vision it would help, or if I wore contacts, but with my glasses on or off I find that I'm just not able to frame a picture easily because of this problem. Your mileage may vary.", "The prints come out very resistant to smudges and tears and even water which I am very pleased with!", "This is such a cool little camera! I love being able to have hard copies of photos to print and share with my friends at events and to have as keepsakes vs scrolling through my phone to find them. The print quality is OUTSTANDING and the price is wonderful too. This is probably the best accessory to have this summer!", "This is a cute instant camera and I have had no issues or complaints with it. It's a novelty camera. It's not high end or high tech, but that's ok. For what it is, it works very well and does what it should.\n\nThe pics dont look bad in my opinion. It takes about 15 seconds after snapping a pic until you see it start to print out and then a few more seconds until it's done. Mine have turned out clear and reasonable quality for the camera. No distortions, no blurry or otherwise 'messed up' pictures.\n\nIt's fun to use and the pictures are nice physical memories instead of everything being online or in our phones.\n\nThe selfie mirror is just big enough to be able to see yourself and has printed out accurately based on what I see in it - meaning that what you see in the mirror is what prints.\n\nFilm loads easily. Theres a light that let's you know when battery is low, when film is loading, film is printing, or is jammed. It will light a different color or pattern per action.\n\nYou can change the aspect ratio by simply pressing a button, as well as reprint with just a press.\n\nCharges fast and you get a decent amount of prints per charge.\n\nIt's cute and fun. I like it.", "Like ease of use. Picture quality good but not great but realize just point and shoot camera. Fun to use.", "This is very easy to figure out and has a decent picture. Certainly not professional level, but good for vacations for the average photographers. Packs well in a suitcase or pocket. Simple and comfortable to hang onto. I like the sticky back paper. You can also scrapbook photos etc. The auto flash and photo duplication function works well. Pretty good smudge resistance. You can get a three year warranty through the company. Seems fairly durable.", "How much you like this camera will have to do with what you're comparing it to.\n\nCameras have come a long way over the years and we're use to the luxury of working with digital images that let you choose whether or not one is nice enough to print, and can use software to enhance photos to fix any flaws. So if you're comparing this one hundred dollar camera to the digital photos you can take with your one thousand dollar cell phone or DSLR camera, yeah you're not going to be pleased with the results.\n\nNow if you're looking for the nostalgia of instant print cameras like the original Polaroid, then this is actually a great option. I have two other newer instant print cameras, both made by Polaroid and the cost of the paper for those is crazy. Like so bad, had I realized the paper was that expensive (and they don't even give you any to start with when you buy the camera) I'd have never ordered them.\n\nThis Cannon however not only comes with paper, but the replacement paper is less expensive than the Polaroid options. Not that the Cannon paper is super cheap, but these types of cameras and their paper never have been inexpensive. Even 50 years ago when they more common, they were still expensive.\n\nFor an instant print camera, the pictures come out well. These aren't good low light cameras. The better the lighting (like outside on a sunny day) the better your photos will come out. And yes if you don't get the photo you want, you have just wasted a piece of the paper. That's how it always has been with these cameras. They never have been professional. They're all about just fun novelties.\n\nMy teenagers love this camera and my daughter buys replacement paper for it often. Teens these days have all kinds of digital photos on their computers, social media and their phone,  but not that many actually in hand. So my daughter loves the idea of taking a photo and it printing right away. She and her friends take the camera to dances and when they're out together, and get all kinds of fun photos together with it.", "This camera is a lot of fun! Sometimes you want to take pictures right away and share them with your friends. Of course, the quality is not going to be anywhere near the quality you can receive on a cell phone (not to mention a DSLR). I also don't love that the cartridges are pretty expensive on this film. It is high enough to where you get upset if you mess up a shot and waste the film.\n\nThe film is pretty easy to insert and remove. I didn't have any problem with getting the photos to work. It is a fun camera to play around with. I personally love capturing moments and would rather have them high quality and get the actual photos printed later. However, if you need low resolution photos immediately this is a great option. It is fun to use.", "Ok, first of all, let's get this out of the way. I'm a professional photographer...but don't worry, I'm not going to review the Cliq as a serious camera. I'm reviewing it as something for my wife (who prefers prints to digital images) to use, or for a kid to carry around.\n\nWe obtained the yellow Cliq, and honestly, it's adorable. Everybody who has seen it has said the same thing.\n\nOnce we charged it up, I took it outside to take some images of our neighbor's flower garden. One thing I noticed RIGHT AWAY is the shutter button is REALLY sensitive, and every time you hit the shutter, you get a print! In the first 15 minutes of use, I accidentally hit the shutter 3 times, and got 3 print outs of nonsense.\n\nThis brings up one of the worst things about this camera/printer: you get a print of EVERY image you take, at about $0.50 per print. Every image. You don't even get a chance to review the image before it prints out - you take the shot, then it starts printing....which leads me to another negative: the printer is agonizingly slow. I didn't time it, but it felt like it took 30 seconds, or more, to print out each shot, and while this is happening, your camera is a brick with a wrist strap.\n\nMy wife used the Ivy Cliq this past weekend, visiting her family out of state. She had thought our 14 year old niece might be interested in the camera, especially since yellow is her favorite color, and if this happened, she was planning on leaving it with her. Well...this didn't work out.\n\nShe gave the Cliq to her niece, and to her 10 year old nephew. After taking one of two images each, they quickly got bored with the delay between shots, and gave the camera back to her. Done. Period. Over.\n\nLet's talk about image quality. It's bad. Colors are VERY washed out, and biased to blue. They're also not terribly sharp, and another big negative, the fact that the viewfinder and the lens are separated by almost 2 inches makes it REALLY difficult to frame your shots, unless you're taking a selfie (more on selfies later). My wife commented that she got very frustrated when she tried to take images, only to find out she's missed her subject, or cut off a hand, part of a head, etc.\n\nFor selfies, the Ivy Cliq has a little mirror (reminds me of similar things some of the first cell phone cameras had) next to the lens to help you approximate getting yourself centered. Works ok.\n\nI provided her a 64GB micro SD card, and the Cliq saved each shot to this card, but she was so dissatisfied with the photos that she had no interest in saving the digital files, or printing them out on our home printer.\n\nShe did use the prints from the Cliq to make a Mother's Day card for her mom, taking images of herself, her sister, and all the grandkids who were there, and her mom was THRILLED with this. Of course, her mom still uses a flip phone that doesn't even have a camera.\n\nOh, I should mention, the prints have peel off sticky back. Nice feature.\n\nI honestly thought our niece would like the camera more than she did, figuring she'd like to take photos of her friends, and maybe stick them on her notebooks, inside her locker, etc., but that didn't happen.\n\nSo, we're gonna keep it around and see if we can figure out when or where to use it. Almost any cell phone camera will do a better job of taking photos. If you need instant prints, maybe the Cliq printer would be a better deal (I presume it accepts images from cell phones, and such), but even then, you're have to deal with the low quality of the Zinc printer technology, so YMMV,", "This is a horrible camera, even as a gimmick one, and that's all this is: a gimmick. The picture quality is just awful, and it automatically prints, no matter how bad the picture. The viewfinder is extremely poor and awkward, and the capture speed is slow. The picture quality is not good, though whether that's the camera or the printer is debatable. It's a great idea for pre-teens, but with the cost of paper refills, definitely not practical. You're better off just using a smartphone and a printer.", "Canon really missed the mark with this one. Here's a case of a company trying to be everything to everyone and failing miserably on this \"camera\". You would never find the name Nikon on something like this!\n\nIt takes borderline terrible pictures and while the novelty of printing out tiny stickers may appeal to some, it automatically prints every picture. I'm sure the technology to take the photo then prompt to print, save or discard isn't terribly complicated or cost prohibitive to have added.\n\nNow having said that, if this camera was $29.95, it would be a great toy for a 8 - 10 yr old to decorate their notebook, but at $100, it's too expensive for what it is. Add the .50 per print, and it really adds up.\n\nSo I would have to say pass on this unless Canon steps up their game and makes some serious improvements on ther next generation of this camera.", "Even though I recieved this product for free, this is my honest opinion and experience with this product.\n\nUsing this camera brings back so many memories. It feels like you are taking photos from the past. What a great experience.\n\nThis little camera is so fun to use. It is so simple, and I love how small the photos are. The build of the camera feels really retro, and modern at the same time. A really sleek design. It feels that \"high quality heavy\" it has some weight to it. But at the same time it is really light.\n\nThe photo quality is pretty good for the size. It does decent in low light, and is pretty accurate with colors. Though sometimes around the edges it does tend to have a more retro fading in color. It is not that noticable. But honestly I love the look.\n\nThe reason it doesnt have five stars.\nThe paper to refill the camera is very expensive. You already pay $100 for the camera itself. Yet you only recieve 10 photo sheets. So I can only take 10 photos. You also cannot pick which images to print. Point click and it automatically prints. So you cannot see if it is blurry or not. So it can be an expensive mistake. It can also be a bit slow on the shutter speed.\n\nFor the price I hoped it would have many more sheets for photos. Or more options for printing. Even a screen to see a little more before you shoot.", "I like this camera. It is easy to load and it is easy to use.  Everything about this camera is nice.  It doesnt go much further.\n\nThis is at its base a point and shoot camera.  It's much like the old instamatic were one would look through the viewfinder and shoot.  You would then hope for a proximity of what you wanted.  I have been able to get some decent pictures, they just havent been great.\n\nOne of my issues is the actual taking of the picture.  You take a picture and the picture prints.  You get a pretty nice picture which is also a sticker.  If you are not careful you might get two pictures or you might take another.  The camera is very sensitive.  Film comes in at about 50 cents a picture so one does need to be careful.  It isnt super expensive but it is enough to make you careful.\n\nThis is an ok camera built by Canon.  The body is tough and picture quality is decent.  This is a tough call between a 3 and a 4.  I gave it a 4 because I gave a blast taking the pictures.", "I thought I would get more use out of taking small, thumbnail-sized photos but that just didn't happen.  For one, the cost of the film paper is prohibitive, especially considering how tiny the picture ends up.  For another, I see this as something that you would use for a business for a specific purpose, and not as a private consumer.  Even though the stickers were fun, once I factored in the cost of each, it took the joy right out of it.", "This is a novelty just like all polaroids throughout history have been.  My kids lived playing with this, but the replcement film is a bit too expensive for their taste.  Quality is fair.  But they have phones that take pics, so they lost interest in this real quick.", "So, to start, the instructions included a few words, but the primary directions are pictures. That\u2019s ok. I figured out that the camera needed to be charged using the enclosed usb charging cord. Charging took less than an hour \u2014 the light changes from red to green when it\u2019s fully charged. I followed the diagram and pictures to figure out which parts function in which way, and read a few reviews that said the shutter was really sensitive. Following the very unclear pictured instructions, I loaded up the paper, closed the back of the camera, and shot a photo. Or so I thought. The camera made some rumbling noises and then the top of the camera started flashing red \u2014 it\u2019s supposed to flash different colors as it\u2019s printing the photo. So, I charged it again just to be sure, checked the insagain, and reloaded the paper. Took another photo. The paper came out blank. Ok. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Give up. Nonsense.", "The Canon Ivy Cliq camera is great for everyone, it\u2019s easy enough for my 10 year old to use but still prints good quality photos for any adults who want these cute little 2x3 sticker photos.\nThe lighting can sometimes be an issue so I would recommend using in well lit areas.\nGreat quality photo paper, we stuck one on the back of the iPad and we haven\u2019t had any problems with it coming up after 4 days of moderate use.\nButton on the camera allows the last photo to be reprinted (which is great for friends) or you can insert a micro sd card and transfer photos to your computer.", "I didn't realize how small the pictures would be (2x3). In comparison the old (and newest) Polaroid cameras take 4.25x3.5 pictures. It's still usable, but it makes it seem even more like a toy. We got two of these camera and some of the pictures are better than others. Some of the pictures have imperfections. There are sometimes a line or two per print where it looks like it didn't didn't print for a line. The kids found it fun, but I'm not sure we'll even buy more film.", "As others have mentioned the picture quality is not that of a newer iPhone. However, I wouldn\u2019t expect that from an instant camera. I trust the canon brand and this seemed to be a pretty good product. I took one picture tonight to test it out and I thought it turned out beautifully. It was super easy to figure out the buttons and where to put everything. (If worried about accidental picture prints I would suggest not putting all the film in at once just in case.) There\u2019s also a wrist strap you can attach which makes it easy to carry it around. I\u2019m excited to take more pictures tomorrow!", "This cute little camera/printer was fun to try out. The setup and installation of the printer paper was easy, the pictures it takes are clear and watching them come out is fun. As a person who remembers the old Polaroid instant picture cameras and the cumbersome paper and the chemical application required to preserve the photos, this little camera/printer from Canon is a revelation and shows how far this technology has come.  The ability to send photos to it via Bluetooth is a stroke of brilliance. There is something about a printed picture that surpasses sending from one phone to another that is fun and friendly. I only found one issue with this device. The power button and the shutter are a hair\u2019s breadth apart, and it only came with 10 printer pages. After one successful photo, I accidently used two more in trying to shut the camera off. Since the paper is pretty costly, this is an indicator that one could waste a lot of expensive paper if one is not very careful. I really think the proximity of the two buttons is faulty engineering. However, it will certainly sell a lot of printer paper for the device. If gifting this camera/printer, please include a couple of packs of paper for it. It will make it a lot more fun for the recipient!", "We bought this for my daughter's birthday in June.  She used it a couple of times in June and July but upon trying to use it during our recent vacation, discovered it no longer works.  It has not been damaged but simply stopped working.  It is, ofcourse, after the 30 day Amazon return window.", "This camera is fun. It's great for instant selfies. Easy to use you just hold it and shoot, what you see in the mirror is what you get in the picture. They become stickers if you want. You can put them on your trapper keeper, or the back of your computer, your fridge or your grandma's fridge. The picture quality is great! Very clear. Hard to believe for those of us who grew up in the 1980s when the only instand cameras gave poor quality no matter how much you shook the picture. Just fun.", "The Canon Ivy Cliq is a simple, easy to use instant print camera that is also able to save to a microSD memory card. The caveat here is that the camera will not work without it having photo paper inside - it is primarily an instant photo camera that happens to save images digitally as well. This means it will print the photo once the shutter is released - no option to cancel the print. Styling of the camera is attractive and minimal - although the \u201cLadybug Red\u201d is closer to a Reddish Pink. There is a selfie mirror on the front of the camera.\n\nThe camera has no displays, but it is intuitive enough. There is an optical viewfinder, and lights show the status of the camera. There is a light on top that glows when the camera is ready to take a picture, and color cycles when it is processing the image. Buttons on the camera are minimal - image size (rectangular 2x3 or Square 2x2), power, reprint and shutter. The camera plays a tone when it\u2019s powered on. The status light can be hard to see in bright outdoors sunlight.\n\nThe camera works best outdoors during the day. Under these conditions, images are colorful. Under less ideal conditions, colors can become muddy, and indoor shots need to be well-lit for the camera to capture something approaching a useable image. The built in flash is somewhat useful, but won\u2019t replace a well-lit scene.\n\nThe camera lens is fixed focus, and is a bit wide - which makes it forgiving when framing up a shot. There is a small delay during shutter release, and the print emerges from the camera after about 50 seconds, fully developed. The camera uses Zink photo print technology. There is no need to shield the print from light when it emerges from the camera.\n\nThis not a camera for hard-core photographers. It is meant to be a fun, spontaneous camera that will take and print photos with minimal fuss. It really works best outdoors where there is a lot of light. Prints average 50 cents apiece, so some thought needs to be taken with each photo, but that is part of why instant photo cameras are special. Overall it\u2019s a fun, easy to use camera.", "The photos that get printed can also be used as stickers which makes it so fun to hang up these photos! I've made quite a few cute collages.", "I got this little instant print camera a couple of weeks ago and it is now something that I take with me everywhere. It is the perfect size for carrying around and for taking photos. It also works so well and produces great photos. I could not be happier.", "Fun little camera for not so serious shots.  My teen loves it.", "I love being able to print out photos whenever I am on the go as it makes the prints all the more special.", "I love the concept of this camera - it's very cute and makes for a great little BFF bonding activity. However, the pictures are not that great and it can get kind of expensive buying the paper. At least with the FujiFilm instant cameras you get a better picture - obviously nothing is going to beat a real camera or a phone, but I just wasn't that impressed. Additionally, it feels like a kid's toy over an actual camera. Cute concept and cute design, but execution was a bit off.", "Because I am a professional photographer, my view of the Canon IVY CLIQ+ Instant Camera Printer Mobile Mini Printer Via Bluetooth may be harsh. However, to me this camera is more reminiscent of a toy camera than the old time Polaroid instant photo cameras that it is supposed to emulate.\n\nCanon makes some superb point-and-shoot cameras. I own two of them\u2014the aged but still very functional Powershot S-90 and the newer and most impressive Powershot G7x Mark II. While I didn\u2019t expect the Canon IVY CLIQ+ to match a camera costing more than four times its cost, I did expect decent photos. I also expected decent instructions\u2014although Canon only included a sketch instruction sheet.\n\nWhat you do get is a camera with a tiny built-in printer that uses special Ivy ZINK paper that produces, at its largest, a 2x3 print. After using up the included five sheets, this paper will set you back 50 cents per sheet. The image quality is not very good. Sure, for a selfie it\u2019s fine, but for anything else you will be better off to grab your smartphone. (I never thought that I\u2019d find myself recommending that in a review!!!)\n\nThere are two models. The Canon IVY CLIQ and the Canon IVY CLIQ+.  The Canon IVY CLIQ+ has built-in WI-Fi and can commute with a smartphone using the Canon Mini Print app. The app is nothing to write home about. Yes it can see your photo library and it can remote control the camera to a point but you can\u2019t see what you are taking before hand and there is only minimal control over the camera.\n\nBoth version support a micro SD card. I inserted one but was unable to tell whether the Canon IVY CLIQ+ was accessing it. Furthermore, I had hoped that, without paper, the Canon IVY CLIQ+ would use the card instead. No such luck. The camera refused to work without paper installed inside.\n\nCanon makes some great cameras. The Canon IVY CLIQ+ and the  Canon IVY CLIQ are not among them.", "The idea of being able to print right from your camera is clever, but I have to think that we're too early on the curve to get the best benefit/value from this type of device. This is not one to be an early adapter on, I think. The cost is high, the quality is low. Give it a couple of years and we'll probably see lots of competition and innovation to improve on this idea - because it *is* a good one.", "So far I am loving this camera except the capture button is very touchy it will print right through the papers if you\u2019re not careful. Wish it had an option to print or cancel. The papers are are not cheap. It comes with 10 of the picture paper to start. Light weight easy to use and you can put in a memory card.", "Although I think I'm being a bit generous with my star rating, I'll stick by it because: IF you knw what you're getting and IF it's what you want, this does do the job well... ish\n\nBasically, this is an updated version of the old Polaroid Land camera of the old days.\n\nIt is EXTREMELY easy to use and it gives you mini-pix in just a few seconds, that you can share with friends, stick on book covers, whatever (to be clear, I mean actual hard-copy pictures 2'x3' or 2\"x2\")\n\nBUT: The pictures are NOT cheap; running about .50 per copy (24.95 for a pack of 50 sheets) However, there IS a slot for a microSD chip for greater flexibility. The pics are of decent quality, but nowhere near what even a mid-line camera or, smartphone can do. The controls are simple enough, but they blend in with the body in such a way as to cause you... alright me... to inadvertently snap without meaning to (did I mention the .50 a pic?)\n\nIn short, I think you'll get limited use out of this, but what use you get will be fun!", "This Canon Ivy CLIQ Instant Camera is like an updated version of a Polaroid! It was a lot of fun to use.\n\nI would say this is more for entertainment instead of serious photography. The photos do not come out as crisp and clear as they show on the product page. I understood this was probably the case before I used it so I wasn\u2019t disappointed. Plus, for the price how good could they come out. I would say this is great for like a party or even for kids.\n\nRefills are very inexpensive so make sure to buy the camera with atleast one pack. Only ten prints are included in the camera. I do like that you can add a memory card so you can upload your images quickly and easily. The face recognition does well as long as there\u2019s good lighting.\n\nOverall, I\u2019m happy. It is a fun little camera. Would be great for office parties, house parties, anything like that. Reminds me of a portable photo booth. Definitely recommend!!!", "I really love this blue instant camera. It is so slim, so it is easy to carry around and I am very impressed with its picture taking capabilities, too!", "This camera is great for kids but the supplies are kind of expensive.  It should have come with some kind of internal storage so that not every picture had to be printed.  Also lack of a screen makes it hard to see what you have.  Kids like it though because they like stickers.", "This camera is so skinny, you would never have expected it to be able to print out such nice looking photos! As a result, it makes it really easy to travel with this camera. I also really like the color of it. I would definitely recommend it to others!", "Didn\u2019t care for this camera at all.

It's really fun that if we get a special one, we can click the reprint button and have it print a second one, and it's easy enough to use that with a few reminders about how we do have to pay for these pictures and so make sure you're getting a shot that you want, my six-year-old can also participate in recording our family events and bond with family members over pictures. The fact that they are stickers adds an extra layer of charm.\n\nWe have good cameras and cell phone cameras and this one fits a niche completely different. Its about the immediacy of the moment and the sharing of special moments with family. The picture quality is perfect for the small size of pictures it creates, but it is not meant to be a high-end camera, it's much more like the old-school Polaroids, which I think all of us probably have a few precious ones in a memory box.\n\nI really appreciate the simplicity of this and how grand parents and children alike can learn to use it and how much fun it is at a party.", "I am obsessed with this ladybug red instant print camera.

I used this while some friends were visiting and it was fun to take some snapshots of their kids and give them the pictures. I think adults were like that\u2019s kind of cool but the kids were ecstatic. The Zink paper also allows you to peel and stick so that was a huge hit. The camera takes a a decent image (5 megapixel) and the printing is fast. The big downside is Zink paper is expensive so you don\u2019t want to waste pictures. Overall, I wouldn\u2019t say you need this camera but if you want something fun and you want to print small photos for people on the spot, this is a great little camera.\n\n*If you found my review helpful, please let Amazon know by clicking the helpful button below!\n\n**Disclosure: I received a sample product from the Amazon Vine program for an honest and unbiased review.", "Not .", "I like how the photos are also stickers that way I can hang them up on my walls to use them as decorations.

With that said, I can explain to you why this product is what you want vs these small vintage-era portable film cameras offer. I bought this as a mother's day incentive so that whenever a holiday comes around, i can print a photo off and give it to them as a friendly gesture.\n\n1. The quality of the photo taken from your phone, is transported onto this device. Meaning, instead of risking wasting film on trial and error, unsure of what you'll get --- you simply take a photo of anything with your camera, and you can print it off. Easy as that. The better (phone) camera, the better end product.\n\n2. Customization. With the onboard software, which I've reviewed and was thanked by the HPSprocket Team, allows you to edit, critique, or just make a photo something entirely new.\n\n3. Personal Achievements: Sometimes we get rewards from our phone, via a email, video game, or just a simple notification. Instead of screenshotting that and sending it to your friend, asking for the same, equal excitement --- you can print that screenshot off, put it in a photo album, and allow yourself to make a bookmark of achievements. The photos I've provided will show you some of the things I've achieved in this year alone and how this device helps with my accomplishments.\n\n4. Stickers. You can apply stickers to virtually any photo you upload onto your sprocket; even as far as taking photos and turning real life animations/stickers/logos and making you're very OWN stickers to apply to your OWN photos! I hope that makes sense; its easier shown than read. You'll get it once you play with the software\n\n4. Up to date software. This is important among all hardware and film. If the software doesn't work, the hardware and YOU, don't either. Updated frequently, with the ability to upload your own photos in case you need that storage on your phone.\n\n5. Film. inexpensive, slightly small, and wallet sized. Depending on the model device you get, this effects the film length/price. I got this model for the cost of film is independent from buying the device.\n\nCons:\nThe color in the photos isn't always the best, and the device needs to be plugged into something for more than 2-4 photos. but the ability to do some of these things with film is extraordinary in the first place; whats the saying? Don't look a gift horse in the mouth?\n\nWith all these these pros, and slight cons, I would suggest this over film any time. You get to practice using digital film, (your phone or what have you.)  the film is inexpensive, and the virtual customization is in any shape, way, possible.\nSuperb choice for those interested in editing photos.\nThe photos above are things I've done with mine. :)", "It works great, connects great, picture quality is what i expected. However, every picture I printed, it would print a red line right through the middle of the photo.  At first, I didn't notice it, then after 3 or 4 photos, i could clearly see the red line.  I thought maybe it was just something that happened that one time, so i printed a few more, and sure enough the red line continued to show and continued to become more and more noticeable.  Now normally, this sort of thing wouldn't bother me, but for the price I paid for this device, I am very disappointed and unhappy.", "Absolute love this .", "Love love love it!!

I called the host of that meeting to learn what they were using and discovered the Owl. I was about to buy a more traditional camera / audio system but I liked the functionality of the Owl.

It is 1080p which I hope will much improve the video performance and I hope the response time for following from speaker to speaker is improved as well.  I will leave a review when I have some experience with the \"Pro\" version.  Having said all that, this version of the Meeting Owl may be quite adequate for less fussy individuals.  You can get it and try it out for 30 days.  Amazon was very helpful when I returned this one to get the new one - no problem.", "This is a great tool for meetings.

I much prefer using a Jabra and a normal webcam for this reason.\n- Image quality isn't great, even in small rooms, everyone looks small and far away.\n- I was expecting this to be 1/4 of the price it's being sold at.", "I just bought this product this week\n This product works as advertised and is really easy to set up. It has totally enhanced the feel of meetings for my remote staff. I use Google Meet/Hangouts.  I can't rate reliability yet, but we're off to a great start.", "Best video conferencing camera/mic combo available. Worth  every single penny.", "I got 2 of them for the office. Great innovativion and concept. Lots of opportunities from the speakers perspective. Quality audio is poor; and volume is too low.", "Owl is really great and has made a big diff in our meetings.  Audio is better than a speaker phone (both mic and output) or tv, and the views rock - in many ways because the camera is simultaneously closer to everyone and also the distance to participants is more evened out.  So you can both see everyone, and make out everyone's face.  And the simplicity is *great* (just plug in and it works, no software to install, extra mics, wires, etc).\n\nSmall asks:\n- It would be nice if the resolved video was slightly higher res so you could read things on whiteboards (without writing super huge)\n- It does seem to pickup HVAC/computer fans just a bit... don't know if there's a way to filter out drone type noises better.\n- Super minor - An indicator on the unit of which way is front (ie, which side is where the split in the panorama view is) so you can split the in-room tv instead of someone's head.", "Good product. People who work remotely for our company really appreciate the expanded views of everyone in the room.\n\nThe sound quality and mic are good. However I feel the video quality could be improved a bit. It\u2019s perfectly usable, but not quite as good as say a mid grade Logitech webcam. Feels a little mushy and slightly underexposed.\n\nGenerally people like it and we\u2019re considering a second one for another conference room.", "Looks super cool. Works as advertised.\nEasy interface... just plug it in via USB and the owl takes care of making all the people show up.\nSound quality is better than our previous VOIP Polycon conference phone.\nOnly recommendations:\n1) it doesn't always key in on who is speaking.  I haven't called support, so they might have a setting or something I need to tweak.\n2) we have a glass wall on one side of the conference room and lots of backlight comes in on that side that degrades the video quality a bit.\n3) our table holds 10 people.  sometimes the Owl has a long way to see folks at the far end of the table and they appear pretty small.\n4) sometimes, where to look if you are in the conf room is awkward.  you want to look the person you are speaking to in the eyes, but that means you have to look at the screen where you are projecting the online participants video feeds.  That is not next to the owl if your owl is in the middle of the table.. so you aren't looking at them when they are looking at you, which makes the non-verbal communication piece still not completely solved.\nI would imagine in a smaller room with a 6 top round table, and no external light coming it, it would be better, but still not sure where to put the screen..", "We bought the Meeting Owl to record meetings, so that those not in attendance can get a different viewpoint than a traditional camera in front of the room. It works well moving around to capture the person that is talking. If someone has a quieter voice, then it has more trouble locating that person than someone who naturally projects their voice or has a deeper voice. The top section of panoramic view is very nice when reviewing recorded video, but it would be a great feature if you could make that top section take up more of the overall viewing screen. For example, the ability to make the panoramic picture take up 40% of the screen instead of a bar across the top. The algorithm for finding voices/people could be improved. You will see sometimes the Owl is \"watching\" nobody, or somebody who stopped speaking two minutes ago.\n  Set up is very easy, two cords two plugs. A neanderthal, if given the correct training, could certainly work the Owl. In fact, the idea that HomoNeanderthalensis was significantly less intelligent than early HomoSapiens may be more myth than reality. Their brain sizes, as indicated by cranium cavity size was slightly smaller, yes, but you can not infer function from size. Case in point; some early Homo species had very large brains, yet we can infer from their evolutionary proximity to aboreal primates and lack of evidence they used tools that they were not particularly intelligent. The human brain as developed a lot over a great period of time. Our brains now contain a vastly more complex structures and compressed amount of neurons than our ancestor's brains did hundreds of thousands of years ago. If you were going to make the argument that brain size alone correlates with intelligence, then you must hold the belief that men are on average more intelligent than females. This is because men often have a physically larger brain. I doubt that someone would hold that belief, however, and it further shows that size does not give any inference about function.\n  Whats more, paleo-archaeological evidence shows that Neanderthals likely lived in complex social units. There have been discoveries that indicate older Neanderthals, possibly in their 60's would have been disabled from injuries suffered, but continued to live on for what is presumed to be decades. This is shown by the healing of broken bones, after all, a broken bone will heal itself if given time and nutrition. So, yes, while the Owl is simple to use let us not disparage our long lost Neanderthal brethren.\n  Overall, we've been happy with our Owl. I would recommend reaching out to OwlLabs with questions or concerns. They appear to be good company, that is to say, a company that is dedicated to serving their customers. It is a novel idea that is useful in a wide variety of applications. Some sort of carrying case/book-bag that protects the device would be a great accessory.  I cannot speak for their take on Neanderthal brain anatomy, or how they feel in general concerning the Neanderthal subspecies.", "Wonderful device .. I use it for my personal customer on-site meetings as we want to get everyone on the call .. I love the experience and how it very well integrates with zoom ..\n\nOnly Con I would say are\n\nSometimes the individual recognition is not very accurate .. and if you\u2019re using it in a conference room with a tv for screen share and audio output (as the speaker in MO might not be loud enough) the individual AI video being generated freaks out and does a never ending split as it thinks there are multiple people that it needs to split as the audio feedback loops in\n\nIf the price is at 500 I would say it\u2019s the best value for money", "Not being able to use this solution with Adobe Connect which wasn't emphasized in the marketing, rendered it useless to our organization.  That said, really liked the approach  and promises of the solution which is very innovative and hope to reevaluate if they support Adobe in the future.", "The Meeting Owl is not your typical video conferencing bird.  This camera/speakerphone combination has a 360\u00b0 camera (no moving parts) and microphone array, allowing the remote participants in the video conferencing meeting to see and hear the entire room. The loudspeaker has a nice tone quality and can get adequately loud for a medium-sized room.\n\nThe Meeting Owl is covered in a nice dark grey fabric rather than a metal grill. Unfortunately, the velcro wraps that I use to manage the cables frequently attach themselves to the fabric. Over time, it\u2019s fuzzing-up the fabric. Plus, the fabric will collect hand oils when the unit is moved around. If you won\u2019t need to move the Owl from room to room, this will be a minimal annoyance.\n\nThe 360\u00b0 panoramic view across the top of the video gives the remote participants a great overview of the room and who is in the meeting. One co-worker calls it \u201cThe Last Supper\u201d view. The remote participants will be aware of everyone in the room. They won\u2019t experience a disembodied voice suddenly coming from off-camera or be surprised to discover that a particular person is attending the meeting but just sitting out of view. This may be a problem for the in-room folk that hate \u201cbeing on camera\u201d - they\u2019ll have to hide under the table.\n\nThe 360\u00b0 camera allows you more flexibility in how you configure your huddle/conference room. You are not limited to a narrow and deep configuration to fit everyone in the field of view of a traditional camera. A round or square table, or even a wide room can work.\n\nThe Owl is tall enough for its camera to just clear a 15.5\u201d screen laptop that\u2019s placed close to it. However, you may need to elevate the placement of the Owl if you have standing meetings with tall people in a small room.\n\nThe \u201cSpeaker Spotlight\u201d view in the main portion of the video window is where the magic happens - automatically \u2018spotlighting\u2019 the person that is talking, up to the three most recent people. This is super handy; the meeting can \u2018just happen\u2019 - no one needs to be responsible to reposition a webcam, or control a PTZ (pan/tilt/zoom) camera to point it at the person currently talking. The free app does allow you to manually override the spotlight as desired.\n\nTip: The Owl doesn\u2019t have an indicator on the unit to show where the panoramic view splits (the far left and right ends). So I put a sticker near the top of the Owl and tell folk to orient the sticker toward the video display to give the best panorama - placing the person opposite the display from the Owl in the center of the panoramic view.\n\nThe video quality is 720p, adequate for typical video conferencing meetings. The video is somewhat \u2018soft\u2019, not sharp, crisp images of some higher end webcams. Most of the time people are either sharing presentation slides or having discussions, not focusing on someone\u2019s skin blemishes, so this may not be a big deal. Plus, many video conferencing systems don\u2019t transmit anything higher than HD and not everyone has the bandwidth to handle much above that either. However, the video \u2018softness\u2019 could be an issue if you regularly have someone writing on a whiteboard in the room. They will need to write bigger and use stronger contrasting colors to combat reflective glare from ceiling lights. Hopefully a future firmware update will improve this particular situation.\n\nFor people accustomed to talking towards a speakerphone, they will naturally face the Owl giving the remote participants a full view of their face. However, many people will naturally turn to the display screen when talking to the remote participants. Depending on where they are sitting in relation to the Owl, the remote participants will end up seeing the person\u2019s profile, or even most of the back of their head! In these situations, either the in-room person or the remote participants may miss nonverbal signals and reactions. Pre-planning where people sit, the placement of the Owl, or even mirroring/multiple displays will help reduce these situations.\n\nThe Meeting Owl can be a great benefit in group discussion meetings. The in-room participants will look at and talk to the other in-room participants. The remote participants will be able to see more facial and physical expressions of the in-room participants, helping them to feel more involved in the discussion rather than disconnected observers.\n\nThe Meeting Owl\u2019s innovative camera and ease of use make it a great option for huddle rooms up to medium-sized rooms depending on room configuration. It can be placed closer towards the person sitting at the far end of the table, and no \u2018camera operator\u2019 is needed. It's a great option to have in my video conferencing toolbox.", "Incredibly easy to set up and use, the Meeting Owl has made a huge difference for our remote workers. During our weekly staff meetings, all of us can now be on camera when we speak and it makes our remote workers feel like they are more a part of the group. The sound is WAY better than our previous webcam and the multiple cameras and speaker focus makes the experience much more inviting. The video is still a little grainy, but I blame that more on our poor lighting than anything else. The Meeting Owl is definitely worth the cost.", "I bought an early model and the Meeting Owl has been great, it does elicit a reaction of either love or fear in some people when they see it but once they are remote in a meeting with one, normal cameras are a letdown. It's hard to describe how much better a dynamic meeting video can be using the owl, it's as if you have a multiple camera tv-studio in your conference room. The audio is clear both from the speakers and the mics for the remote person. Love it and we bought more.", "The owl is awesome.\nI ordered it from the US to Europe because it\u2019s not yet available in Europe.\nThere is no other solution that is that simple and useful.\nAfter the first one I ordere another one for our 2nd meeting room. Very cool.\nEveryone who joins our meetings is amazed now by the visibility it provides.", "The Owl is amazing and really makes connecting with remote teams seamless. The AI around automatically moving the camera to whoever is speaking is truly cutting edge and it ultimately the differentiation against other corporate meeting cameras. Super easy and simple to set up and does not connect to your company's internet directly, but rather through your computer, so any issues around data security/privacy is solved as your already encrypted computer provides all the broadband needed to use the Owl. 100% would recommend to anyone working with colleagues in remote locations.", "This is my second one - first one is in such demand, we needed another.\n\nThese are great for meeting in smaller rooms for upto 12 or so people. It actually holds up better than expected in larger conference rooms, but sound and picture quality degrade. It's all about the placement of people around the OWL and their proximity to the OWL. The larger the room, the further people will be spaced from the OWL, so naturally you'd have diminishing returns. I think optimally people should be maybe 8-10ft max from the OWL.\n\nI love that this is a self contained unit that does all the thinking - no special drivers needed. So far it has been truly plug and play. Plug it in and not only does the system automatically recognize it, but Zoom will usually select it automatically as the default for cam/mic/speaker. We've only had to enter into the system settings once or twice to force it to recognized and used as the default.\n\nFolks at the remote end love that this tracks the speaker. They can see who is talking as well a panorama of the entire group - at the same time.\n\nCONS:\nCost: at $800 it was not an easy decision to make the first time around. After working with one for a while I am sold on how well it works, but still steep at $800.\n\nMics: Not really a CON but more of a wish-list item. For larger rooms it is the speaker and mics that degrade faster than the cam. It would be great if this could work with external mics and speakers. I could then set up my wireless conference mics/speakers around the room and let the OWL handle the cam. The cam still holds up pretty well in larger spaces - better than the single POV cams. Folks really like being able to see everyone in the room with the inside-the-circle 360 view. However, as it is the OWL is dependent on the internal mics to track the direction of the current speaker. I haven't actually tested external mics/speakers with the OWL, but I suspect that it would work just fine, but just not be able to track the speaker. Worst case scenario might be that the CAM would bounce around trying to figure out who to focus on. I'll get a chance to test this out at some point.\n\nItem Reviewed: Meeting Owl 360 Degree Video Conference Camera", "My boss loves it. looks cute at office. it could be great if owl can move a bit more and make sound more.

We're thinking of giving our Owl a personal name - it's working with the team just like we hoped it would!", "The Owl worked well in quiet rooms for a couple of people. The picture quality was good and the automatic switching to different speakers ok. In another room - the intended destination - it didn't work so well, in fact it kept focusing it's picture on the wall between two speakers. Sadly this meant it's time was up and it was returned for credit.", "Software is excellent and product is fantastic both sound and picture capture, video is best for meetings of smaller groups", "So many times the device is great but the setup is a nightmare or the setup is easy and the device doesn't work.

This camera is perfect! The sound quality is great and the receiving end is also solid sound quality. I will be adding two more to our other conference rooms as soon as we get the chance. The picture quality isn't super Hi-Def but good enough for what its needed for, that could also be the median we are using for conferencing. The one drawback may be having to plug it directly into a computer which is on a wall behind an 80-inch screen, about 10 feet away. I currently have a USB extender running it back to the computer, I suggest if you do this you get one that includes AC power adapter otherwise the signal will not come through as it should. Hope this helps anyone make a decision as it really is a fantastic camera!", "I thought it would be a gimmicky add on to our office space, but we have received a ton of great feedback from our remote employees (and one of our clients actually purchased one for their office as well after one of our virtual meetings).

My only gripe is the picture quality, but it\u2019s actually not that bad. It\u2019s not crystal clear, but it\u2019s still pretty good. I mean really, what can you ask for? It has a 360\u2019 view and automatically follows up to three active speakers within that field. Asking for perfect picture quality on top of that is a bit greedy. I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll improve in its next iteration, but considering this is the first version the company has made, they had made a great initial product. When a newer version is out, I\u2019ll probably get it. But until then this is gonna meet and exceed my needs.", "Great feature and unique design.

They say it requires a software update, it has been downloading now for a while.  The app does not give you status of the download, so I have no idea when it will be finished.  If I can not get the camera working after the update, assuming I can get that done, I will be sending this back.", "Found this after trying just about every other (and much more expensive system).

There are many really expensive options out there, but as a non-profit we were hesitant to invest thousands of dollars on a fancy schmancy system. So when MeetingOwl was recommended by an operations colleague in another state, I looked into it. The camera has worked great for us and our board members have been really impressed. They love using it with our GoToMeeting platform so they can avoid traffic while still getting to attend committee meetings. In addition, this has been a great addition to our weekly staff meetings with people across the state. This was a great purchase for our organization and I would highly recommend it for any organization or company's conference room.", "The camera does not track people properly. It frequently cuts them in half on the camera view. For the price I expected proper tracking. Very disappointing and made me look bad for recommending it.

The Owl does a great job of zooming in on the individuals that are speaking and really does a good job of making remote viewers feel like they are in the same room.  The microphone does a great job of picking up individuals sitting within ~6 feet of the table (doesn't do so well picking up individuals that are standing).  The speakers in the Owl are loud and clear (typically much louder than the maximum volume on a comparable dedicated speakerphone).  I Will probably order several more for each of our conference rooms.", "The Owl allows us to include remote employees in small (2-6 people) staff meetings.

You can move the focus manually using the phone app, but you can't make the panoramic view go away.

This group runs many hundreds of videoconferencing connections every year and is well-versed in the technology. The idea behind the camera is an interesting one, but this implementation still needs some work. The image resolution is a good bit lower than I would expect from a modern videoconferencing camera. Images are muddy and straight-line structures are very clearly pixelated. While the device can be plugged in via USB to a computer as a camera input, it wants you to use a mobile device and app to log in to a wireless network to obtain firmware updates. This process is not at all smooth, as it refuses to connect to standard corporate wireless networks and fails to request necessary credentials for logging in. Finally, units are registered not to the e-mail address supplied, but to the domain as a whole. This means that after I registered this device to our group's email address, I found that I had access to the analytics of every single device at our very large institution. This is a significant issue for data security. What does work well is its ability to identify sources of sound to put on camera, including open doorways where there may be people talking well down a hallway. Perhaps some image analysis would help here, so that the device checks to see if there's an actual human in that part of its field of view before putting it on camera.", "Amazing for office use. Easy to use and install. Loved it.", "The Owl has been a wonderful addition to our conference room, especially for me as a remote worker. With the Owl, I feel like I am right there in the room. The unit has been particularly helpful in our larger team meetings because of its ability to focus naturally on the side conversations just as easily as the primary speaker. This feature is great for getting a full perspective on what is happening in the room letting me decide where I can contribute to the conversation best. And because the Owl is generally centered in the room I get a better view of the team's body language and what they really think of the conversation, which doesn't always come across in conference room systems that are positioned at one end of a room. It's also affordable when one of those fancy conference room systems is just a bit too much for the budget, but you need to stay connected with your remote teammates.", "The meeting Owl 360 is amazing for remote meetings. Easy to install and use! I would highly recommend it to everyone!!!", "I was a very happy beta participant. The Owl delivers on its promises. It's been a big hit at our company and really improved our meeting experiences on both sides of the wire. For those on the remote side, it's been a huge improvement to make us feel more connected and more a part of the room. Those on the Owl side love that there's no more fussing to get devices set up or adjusted. The 360 degree camera is very cool and does a really good job of moving its focus quickly from speaker to speaker. The mic is excellent. It's easy to set up, and once it's plugged into USB it basically operates itself. It's fairly portable to move around to different meeting rooms. Plus, it's cute (it hoots!).\n\nCaveat: if you don't use a good, modern video conferencing platform you might be disappointed with how that platform displays the video from the Owl -- you need a nice wide window to fit the 360 degree view of the room. So use a good conferencing platform (we switched to one of the popular free ones and it's great).", "Excellent microphone\nvery poor speaker.....very low volume can barely be heard by every one in the room, only the one just beside it can hear it weekly, ended up using another speaker with it\nsent an email requesting support , they never responded\nyou should have iOs app to control the zooming on speaker, android app doe snot work", "Works great.  Buying more", "We really want to like the owl but it's having mixed reactions around the office. Sound quality is great in Google meet. Picture quality is a bit grainy overall and has issues with the windows in our conference room. Speaker volume just isn't as loud as we'd like. And when used with our uberconference account, sound quality really suffers.\n\nUpdate after a few months - audio quality has been getting worse. There's no background noise reduction and sounds like sirens that are 4 stories away deafen meeting attendees.", "I work for a company with about 26K employees, where infrastructure is pretty locked down but we realize that \"digital is coming\" and that we have to be more flexible. My review is really for the corporate IT department trying to figure out what the heck this thing is, is it a security risk, and where do we go from here.\n\nFirst, we wanted to know that this can be used in fully stand alone mode-- USB only-- as a webcam. It can. Internet is not absolutely required, it does work with Pixelbook and Chromebooks, it does work with Windows 10 with no additional manual driver loads required.\n\nIT does do what it claims, scanning the room, identifying humans, making them the center of the video when they are speaking as you would expect from a very large, very expensive video conferencing system. The video quality was \"good\" but I wouldn't call it exceptional.\n\nNext: Firmware updates. Yes it does require some kind of wifi based internet connection and a smart phone app to initiate firmware updates. At this point we have users using their smart phone as a mobile hotspot to manage firmware updates. We don't allow unauthenticated devices without MDM on our wireless network today, so this was the most logical short term workaround.\n\nNext: Can it be secured? Not really. I thought it was running Android, haven't been able to confirm what OS is on it.\n\nFinally: The Registration: This is probably the part that, at first was the most concerning from a corporate IT perspective. It has its own cloud based utilization/ status/ statistics gathering program that allows anyone with a corporate email address who registers a unit to see all of the other units in the environment. I discovered that we had two other units registered. In reality a person could register the unit on a personal email account and we'd never know about it, etc. This is the murky part that we haven't fully settled in on.\n\nAs of now the units are still allowed for use and we haven't made any clear conclusions on starting up an IoT type dedicated SSID, though this is not the only product driving that kind of decision it's certainly one of them.\n\nThe device does accomplish it's goal of making a remote worker feel more part of the team and for that, there were few to no other prefect alternatives.", "The Owl is one of my favorite devices ever.  It is transformational to meet with a group of people and be able to see each one of them face to face.", "Absolutely awesome piece of equipment for our company. We use the Meeting Owl to hold sales meetings in two different cities and they work great. We use them with Office Skype and we are very satisfied. We have tried numerous other methods without this level of success.", "Camera is great sound and voice are ok", "Easy set up and worried perfectly in our small conference room", "Bought this for our stand up meetings, amazing concept and adheres to the present person speaking. Really impressive! Price point is definitely on the higher end, but will help when you have 20+ team members and majority being remote dialing in.", "Very high quality, I recommend it!", "Video is very good. A solid product. The quick recognition of who is speaking is impressive. The only thing that prevents it from getting 5 stars is the audio. We are finding it is still better to dial in to a meeting and use a conference room phone instead of the Owl's integrated microphone and speakers.", "The meeting owl was exactly what we were looking for.  We were tired of attaching a webcam to our conference room displays.  The webcams were never where we wanted them, and they were exactly as Owl Labs explains them in their demos.  You get the birdseye view, and it is never ideal.  The Owl can be positioned anywhere, and the quality is sufficient for small/medium conference spaces.", "This device is awesome. It took a little while before the cameras would shift to the speaker fast enough, but once the AI figured the room out, it was good. What a wonderful, useful and cost effective solution.", "Company support and sales rep experience not great.  I bought a system about a month ago and asked if they will ahve a new upgraded camera system.  Thye did not say anything and now they have Pro systems.  My Logitech $50 camera quality is better than this $750 system.", "We tried many different ways to record the audio of the meeting. Local, remote, cloud, but none is a good quality.\nThe audio quality is fair enough to listen to people during the meeting but we were expecting very good recording quality for speech recognition. This is not the case.", "I like it very much. I bought one. We tried at the office and then bought other four.\nVery satisfied.", "Would like option to turn off noise cancellation to test if audio pickup improves", "It's working very well for our needs. We use it with Zoom.", "I love this product. It's difficult to describe without using it, but\n\nI work in Cambridge and company HQ is in Milan. We use the owl multiple times a week where there are many people in both offices and the Owl's panning to the speaker makes me feel much more like I'm there. It's not a replacement for in-person meetings, but when you know the people on the other side it makes remote meetings nearly as productive as when we're in the same location.\n\nI was reminded of how good Owl is when I had to conference call with a local (I'm in Cambridge, MA) university group who was using a laptop camera. It was awful. I couldn't see hand gestures, I had to figure out who was speaking based on their voice (more difficult when I'm less familiar and it's a large group). It made me really appreciate the owl.\n\nI can't go back. I won't go back.", "We use the Owl with our Zoom account.  Audio and video quality are good and it is easy to use.  Plus, people find the owl appearance fun.", "Cool great for video conference with multiple people in the room.  Although people do get a little more shy about speaking up when they see their picture on the video screen.  The microphone and audio is barley ok.  It will pick up the drone of the HVAC system and amplify it that has created extra noise and feedback before.  Also one of the units if you touching some of the wires it decides to reset itself and we lose about 60 seconds.  We have switched back to just a Jabra 510 in a USB for Audio which works like a champ and is preffered by most people.", "I was looking to buy a system that was compact yet powerful and would be helpful with our large team meetings in countries all over Central and Eastern Europe.  The Meeting Owl met every standard that we were looking for and more.  We tested one owl for a month then bought 13 more for each of our teams and it has impacted our online meeting in a very positive way.", "I've been a regular user of Conference equipment which is positioned under or over the TVs, where it works well you end up with a cluster of people at the far end, who you can't always see or hear (relying on additional mics etc).\n\nThe owl uses a 360 degree view, which shows the entire room, and a adaptive view, which splits the feed to whoever is talking. It works really well.\n\nPositives;\n\nYou get a more immersive feeling of people in a room, and a better focus on the person who is speaking\nBecause its in the middle the audio pickup is good.\nAs a speaker it works quite well.\nThe whole room is view can be useful.\n\nNegatives\n\nThe unit takes a while to start its video feed\nAs its in the middle you need to run a long cable back to the PC, which in my case as been back to the TV.\nI can't control whether I want the whole room in view or not.\nThe overall quality is adequate but not as good as others.\nIt sometimes takes time to focus on a speaker, so you can't see them for 10-20 seconds.\nNo remote viewer control\nYou get the sides of peoples faces as they're facing a fixed TV !\nThe wifi app is useful, but more complex than expected to setup. Its a shame more wifi features couldn't be leveraged\n\nSummary\n\nIt's certainly more immersive than a single POV, and as such we're still testing the water, but we enjoy the two we now have.", "These things are really impressive. I haven't seen any other product that does as good a job of making remote workers feel like they're in the room. The video gives a much more natural impression of seeing everyone than a fixed side view or even each person in the room having their own camera. It's especially impressive that it works well in tiny rooms as well as moderately sized rooms. At large sizes (> 12 feet from the owl) you run into trouble being too far from the mic.", "This thing is perfect for a small/medium conference table.  The magic is all in the 360 camera and the voice tracking.  It really does do what they say; it tracks who is talking and tracks the camera to their part of the view.  It also does a remarkable job of keeping track of multiple talkers in a split pane view on the bottom, all the while maintaining the panorama on the top.\n\nPlus, it takes no installation on user computers; it behaves just like any other USB device.\n\nAnd those eyes... everyone is charmed by the eyes.", "We have group conference calls all the time.  While there are many Web conferencing apps available on the market, the Owl adds a new dimension to \"virtual presence\" bringing a very strong interaction among participating audiences.  Very nice product and would recommend.", "I bought the MO after having articles forwarded to me from (2) different people in the same day about it and then gettting inundated with social media ads... so good news for the Meeting Owl marketing team, your marketing worked.\n\nWe do morning \"Huddles\" where we have approximately 20 people in one room and a few other people remotely video conferencing in.  We use mainly Chrome OS with Zoom running in a web browser.  Our normal setup is a wide view camera on the top of a TV at one end of the room.  The room is fairly large, approximately 25-30 feet long and 15 feet wide.\n\nWe tested it with a huddle this morning and overall it worked well -- some takeaways so far:\n\n* It definitely has a \"cool\" factor -- people found themselves staring at the screen to see if it noticed they were speaking... we dubbed it \"Witchcraft\" :)\n\n* The speed at which is detects who is speaking can vary -- sometimes it picks them up right away, sometimes it is a little slower to respond.  My guess is it is trying to decipher between someone making rustling noises with paper (ie: not important sounds) vs. important sounds like speaking.\n\n* Our room is large -- the remote users noted that the audio was similar to the high end video conference microphone we normally used -- which was an original concern of mine.\n\n* Since our room is so large, one comment is that the people tend to have a lot of \"white space\" around them -- it would be nice if the Owl could zoom in on them, even digitally, to make them look larger... possibly there could be a setting for the type of meeting (small/medium/large room and if people are sitting or standing, or distance most people are from camera, etc).  When sitting I don't think this would be as much an issue as when we stand for our huddles.  I'm not sure if the resolution of the camera currently is high enough to support this.\n\n* The remote users noted it was an improvement to be able to see the face of the person speaking.  Normally they have to guess who is speaking based upon recognizing the voice.\n\n* We had a few minor glitches... there was one situation where my body was directly on a split and MO would not center on me.  I could see my left and right arms but the middle of my body was on the camera split.  I made sure to talk directly at it was not able to pick up.\n\n* The full room view is not very useful when having a large conference (huddle) type setup -- the remote users considered it more \"gimmicky\" and not effective as it was too small.  It also takes up the screen real-estate and so the direct shots of people are smaller.  Two options: A) It would be nice to have the option in the app to turn that feature off.  B) It would be cool if it could  \"auto turn off\" if someone within the same room was not speaking.  For example if only a remote person was speaking, show the full room, but once someone within the room is speaking  then show only the large views of people (and get rid of the panorama) as it is not as relevant.  This may be tough as you would have to figure out how MO could determine the difference between a speaker and the TV [Maybe the app would allow defining the location of the TV in the setup to aid MO in this].\n\n* Along with having an app to change settings -- I may have a number of staff using the device and not be connected to MO for settings.  It would be cool to have mini QR code cards (think index card type things) that we could hold up to the MO camera to change settings.  If my team wanted to turn the Panorama on/off, they could just hold up a QR code to the MO and it would change the setting instantly.  We don't want people fumbling with their phones or having to \"connect\" it if they have not already.  [Feel free to send me a free MO if you use that idea LOL]\n\n* One unintended side effect: The MO makes me much more aware of the bald spot on the back of my head... I can now see it when I look at the TV. :)", "Great Product", "Excellent product, works great for our multi-office meetings. We even send them to clients (with a return label of course!) for multi-person onboardings. Picture quality is great, sound quality is great. Simple and easy to set up and use with Zoom!", "Ideal to place in the middle of a small to midsize conference table. To my knowledge, the camera doesn\u2019t zoom, so be aware of that if your meetings require this feature. However, the fact that it knows who is talking and flips the camera over to them is pretty slick. We used this routinely on video conferences with up to 10 people in our conference room. We have recommended the OWL several times to others after they saw us using it.", "My company purchased the Owl a month ago. Yesterday, I participated in a meeting remotely. Most of the participants were in a conference room, while a few of us participated via webex. It felt like I was in the meeting room! I could see everyone around the conference room table, and the device highlights the person speaking. This will save a lot of money on travel expenses. I only wish it was a little smaller so we could travel with it more easily. It fits in a carry-on, but the box is about the size of a shoe box and takes up a fair amount of space. Overall, this is a great product and works well for distributed teams.", "Just got my Meeting Owl in the mail yesterday. I ordered it so long ago I can't actually remember when I did it but it was sometime last summer when they were promoting the heck out of it. It looked cool so I ordered one to try for my real estate business. Unfortunately it took over 6 months to get here and I had already bought another webcam.\n\nNonetheless, I tried it out today in a meeting with some colleagues. We all agreed the constant jumping around as it tries to figure out who is talking is distracting.  One of our team on the far end said it made it impossible to concentrate on what people were saying because she was fixated on watching the camera move around. Maybe it's because we have been using a different camera and are used to a steady view but the experience wasn't what we expected. We'll be going back to our old camera for now.", "We use Microsoft Teams for our internal meetings, and Zoom for external meetings. From day one OWL has been a big disappointment, Keep away from this product, it\u2019s buggy and long way to go before it get to where the company wants the product to be, very disappointed.", "Wonderful and powerfull tool!!!", "Lo pr\u00e1ctico, peque\u00f1o y funcional", "The Owl works as advertised, simply setup (plug in one USB port), and provides a great immersive experience for remote meeting attendees.  We liked it so well we bought three more :)", "Best product in the market for 360 and follow the speaker. Would buy it again", "Love our Owl.  It works well for our small team to connect with our remote employees and clients.  Sound and picture quality are great.  We normally can't hear well with other solutions when on video conferences, but with our Owl, we actually needed to turn down the volume a bit!  :)", "So far this is the best video conferencing equipment we have ever used.  It is a bit slow to pick up new voices sometimes.  It really allows good visuals and good microphones so all can fully participate without frustration. It is pricey but there are not many good options less pricey.", "We\u2019ve used the Owl Leora about 5 months. Very reliable and clear camera. The speaker is great. Also, I like the portability of it as we move it from meeting room to meeting room. I actually took it out of town to a remote board meeting. Worked great. Since we show some smaller products during our presentations, I love that we can move the Owl clofser to the presenter versus having to use ha zoom thingy. Great for businesses who want remote meetings with human connection."], "hoffset": 10, "voffset": 10}, {"type": "toptoolbar"}]});
