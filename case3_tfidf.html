This may be due to variations in the configurations of the EUT in practice, physical or practical limitations. Examples of these arrangements include:\u2022 wall, ceiling or rack mounted,\u2022 handheld,\u2022 body worn.For example, a video projector can be positioned in various ways with respect to walls, ceiling or the floor of a room.

If another measurement distance is used, the report shall include a description of how the limits were calculated.Further guidance is given in Annex F.", "10 Compliance with this publicationCompliance with this publication requires that the EUT satisfies either the Class A or Class B requirements defined in Annex A, as appropriate. An EUT which fulfils the applicable requirements specified in Annex A is deemed to fulfil the requirements in the entire frequency range from 9 kHz to 400 GHz. No measurements need be performed at frequencies where no requirement is specified.Where this publication gives options for measuring particular requirements with a choice of measurement methods, compliance can be shown against any of the specified limits using the appropriate measurement method. In any situation where it is necessary to re-measure the equipment to show compliance with this publication, the measurement method originally chosen shall be used in order to guarantee consistency of the results, unless it is agreed by the manufacturer to do otherwise. Requirements for radiated emission measurements are defined in Table A.2 to Table A.7 with the restrictions and limitations defined in Table A.1. Requirements for conducted emission measurements are defined in Table A.9 to Table A.13 with the restrictions defined in Table A.8.The determination of compliance with this publication shall be based solely on contributions from the EUT. For example, where an AE is required to exercise or monitor the EUT, and emissions from the AE are known to contribute to the overall measured emission of the system being assessed (for example an AE which is a plug-in module for the EUT), the AE selected should, wherever possible, be compliant with relevant emission limits. If the AE is known to cause significant emissions, these emissions may be reduced by mitigation measures, as long as these measures do not reduce the emissions from the EUT. The preferred configuration is that the AE is removed from the measurement area, as allowed by D.1.Compliance can be shown by measuring the EUT\u2019s emissions when operating its functions simultaneously, individually in turn, or any combination thereof.", "11 Measurement uncertaintyThe measurement instrumentation uncertainty shall  be calculated in accordance  with CISPR 16-4-2 and reported as described in Clause 9.Measurement instrumentation uncertainty shall not be taken into account in the determination of compliance.

The measurement arrangement of the EUT, local AE and associated cabling shall be representative of normal practice.The EUT shall be arranged in accordance with the requirements of Table D.1", "Table D.1 \u2013 Measurement arrangements of  EUTIntended operational arrangement(s) of MMEMeasurement arrangementRemarksTable-top onlyTable-topFloor-standing onlyFloor-standingCan be floor-standing or table- topTable-topRack mountedIn a rack or table-topOther, for example wall mounted, ceiling mounted, handheld, body wornTable-topWith normal orientationIf the equipment is designed to be mounted on a ceiling, the downward-facing portion of the EUT may be oriented facing upward.If a physical hazard would be caused by testing the device on a table top, then it can be arranged as floor standing and the test report shall document the decision and justification.All cables that are considered part of the EUT shall be arranged as for normal use subject to length restrictions given in Table D.2 and subject to the requirement to minimise the size of the arrangement. For example, the keyboard and mouse of a personal computer set-up shall be placed in front of the monitor.The following arrangements may be used to limit the effects of adverse AE emissions or to reduce measurement time, as long as the arrangement can be shown not to reduce the emissions measured from the EUT:\u2022 placing AE below the RGP;\u2022 placing AE below the test volume of a FAR; or,\u2022 placing AE outside the measurement area when it is normally located distant from the EUT.An EUT intended for rack mounting may be arranged in a rack or as table-top equipment. An EUT that can be used in both floor standing and table-top configurations, or both floor standing and wall mounted configurations, shall be assessed in a table-top arrangement. However, if the usual installation is floor standing, then that arrangement shall be used.The type and construction of cables used in the measurement set-up shall be consistent with normal or typical use. Cables with mitigation features (for example, screening, tighter/more twists per length, ferrite beads) shall only be used if it is the intention that all deployments will use these features. If the cable(s) have mitigation features, this detail shall be specified in theCISPR 32:2015 \uf6d9 IEC 2015 \u2013 55 \u2013test report. Manufacturer-supplied or commercially available cabling  shall  be used,  as specified in the installation manual or user manual.Cables connecting to AE located outside the measurement area shall drop directly to, but be insulated from, the RGP (or turntable where applicable), and then be routed directly to the place where they leave the test site. The thickness of the insulation shall not be more than 150 mm. However, cables which would normally be bonded to ground should be bonded to the RGP in accordance with normal practice or the manufacturer\u2019s recommendation.During conducted emission measurements on analogue/digital data ports, the cable between the EUT and the measurement device or probe shall be as short as possible and satisfy the requirements given in Table D.2.Where practical, any excessive length in cables shall be bundled non-inductively, at the mid point between the EUT and the AMN or AAN, for the conducted emission measurement. The bundle length shall be less than 0,4 m to satisfy the distances given in Table D.2.Non-inductive bundling means that the cable is shortened by overlapping loops arranged with alternate end loops wound in opposite directions using the minimum practicable bend radius. Where bundling cannot be achieved, coiling of the cables shall be avoided.The effective length of all loop-back cables not routed overhead shall be longer than 2 m. Where possible, loop-back cables shall be arranged so that outgoing line is not closely coupled to the return.Where possible, the effective length of mains cables shall be 1 m \u00b1 0,1 m.Cable length is the distance between cable connector ends, excluding any protruding pins, when the cable is laid straight. The effective cable length, is the distance between cable connector ends, excluding any protruding pins, when the cable includes one or more bundles. The effective cable length will be shorter than the actual length if the cable has been bundled.Loads and/or devices simulating typical operating conditions shall be connected to at least one of each type of interface port of the EUT. If loading (or terminating) with a device of actual usage is not feasible, the port should preferably be loaded with a simulator. Where these options are not practical the port shall be loaded by the application of a typical impedance considering both the common and differential modes. These loads and/or devices shall be connected via a cable if this represents normal usage.Where there are multiple ports of the same type the manufacturer shall determine whether to load these additional ports, considering:\u2022 maximisation of the emission levels, for example, when adding additional cables does not significantly affect the emission level (for example varies less than 2 dB), it can be assumed a maximum has occurred;\u2022 reproducibility;\u2022 achievement of a representative configuration having regard to other requirements in this clause.For example, additional cables with or without terminations may be connected to the EUT ports. This process may also be applied to establishing the number of similar elements (plug- in modules, internal memory, and so forth) within the EUT.Where the EUT has more than one analogue/digital data port, ports shall be included in the measurement arrangement as follows:\u2022 if there are multiple similar ports on the same card or module type, then it is acceptable to assess one typical port,\u2013 56 \u2013 CISPR 32:2015 \uf6d9 IEC 2015\u2022 where there are ports of the same type on different card or module types, then it is acceptable to assess one typical port on each card or module types.The test report shall identify the ports assessed.An EUT which requires a dedicated ground connection shall be bonded to the RGP or to the chamber wall or chamber floor in case of a FAR, with a grounding connection that is similar to that used in practice.When making measurements in a FAR, any measurements of height are referenced to the bottom of the test volume.NOTE When testing in a FAR, measurements of height are made to the top surface of the turntable or the top of the floor absorber when the floor absorber extends above the turntable.Any antenna masts and supporting floors shall be in place during site validation. All other relevant conditions of Table D.1 and Table D.2 apply. For example, unpainted expanded polystyrene may be used as a supporting platform above the turntable.See Figure D.1 through Figure D.10 for examples of arrangements.

Where practical, the rear of the EUT should be flush with the rear of the table.For radiated measurements the table shall be made of a material with a dielectric constant which minimises the impact on the results, for example, by the use of unpainted expanded polystyrene. Subclause 5.5.2 of CISPR 16-1-4:2010/AMD1:2012 describes a measurement to help ensure that the dielectric qualities of the material used for construction of the table are appropriate.The arrangement of external power supply units (including AC/DC power converters) shall meet the requirements of Table D.2. Where possible, cables that connect between modules or units shall hang over the back of the table. If a cable hangs closer than 0,4 m from the horizontal RGP (or floor), the excess shall be folded at the cable centre into a bundle no longer than 0,4 m, such that the bundle is 0,4 m above the horizontal RGP.If the mains port input cable is less than 0,8 m long, (including power supplies integrated in the mains plug) an extension cable shall be used such that the external power supply unit is placed on the measurement table. The extension cable shall have similar characteristics to the mains cable (including the number of conductors and the presence of ground connection). The extension cable shall be treated as part of the mains cable.Power supply output cables shall be treated as inter-unit cables.Equipment may be stacked if this is a normal arrangement for this equipment.Example measurement arrangements are given in Figure D.1 to Figure D.5 and Figure D.8.", "D.1.3 Floor standing arrangementWhere cable routing is specified by the manufacturer, this routing shall be used.Where the inter-unit cabling is typically routed overhead, it shall be routed vertically to an overhead support. Overhead inter-unit cables shall rise from the first unit up to the support, run along the support, and drop down into the other unit. Overhead exit cables shall rise from the first unit up to the support, run along the support to a specified distance, drape down to the RGP, and route out of the facility to remote AE. Excess cable shall be bundled non- inductively on, but separated from, the RGP (respecting separation distances as defined in Table D.2).Mains cabling shall drape vertically to (but be insulated from) the horizontal RGP.The EUT shall be insulated (by insulation of maximum thickness of 150 mm) from the horizontal reference ground plane. If the equipment requires a dedicated ground connection, this shall be provided and bonded to the RGP.Examples are given in Figure D.6 and Figure D.9.CISPR 32:2015 \uf6d9 IEC 2015 \u2013 59 \u2013", "D.1.4 Combinations of table-top and floor standing EUT arrangementThe following specific arrangements apply.For the assessment of a combination of table-top and floor standing EUT, two RGPs may be required. The horizontal plane is always the RGP for the floor standing equipment while the RGP for the table-top equipment during conducted emission measurements may be either horizontal or vertical. The inter-unit cables between a table-top unit and a floor standing unit which are long enough to drape on the horizontal RGP shall be non-inductively bundled (or if too short or stiff for bundling, arranged but not-coiled) and placed on the table or supported at 0,4 m or at the height of the lowest cable entry point if this is below 0,4 m.Examples of general arrangements are given in Figure D.7 and Figure D.10.", "D.1.5 Arrangements for radiated measurement in a FARWhere necessary, an access hole should be provided in the centre of the turntable to facilitate routing of cables.Mains power outlets may be placed on the surface of the turntable (or supporting element), if the site validation requirements for the chamber can be met in this configuration.The arrangement of the EUT and local AE shall be identical to those used for measurements using a OATS/SAC/FSOATS except for cables that leave the test area. These cables shall be routed horizontally with a minimum exposed length of 0,8 m, before being routed vertically with a minimum of exposed length of 0,8 m, to the bottom  of the test  volume (See Figure D.12). They shall then be routed to the centre of the turntable where, if possible the cables shall drape vertically downward. The cables shall then leave the chamber by the shortest possible route to minimise any impact. Where the cables are shorter than 1,6 m, as defined by the manufacturer, then the horizontal component shall be as close to 0,8 m as possible.Example measurement arrangements are given in Figure D.11 and Figure D.12.", "D.2 MME-related conditions for conducted emission measurement\u00a0D.2.1 GeneralD.2.2 Specific conditions for table-top equipmentD.2.3 Specific requirements for floor standing equipmentD.2.4 Specific requirements for combined table-top and floor standing equipment", "D.2.1 GeneralDuring measurements of conducted emissions, any required dedicated ground connection of the EUT shall be made to the reference point of the AMN.

All other units of the EUT and AE shall be connected to a second (or multiple) AMN(s). It is acceptable to connect these other equipments to an AMN via extension cables that include one or multiple socket outlets. Where additional socket outlets are needed, the extension shall be as short as practical. All AMNs shall be bonded to a RGP.\u2013 60 \u2013 CISPR 32:2015 \uf6d9 IEC 2015For AMNs mounted below the RGP an extension cable may be used. The AMN specification shall be met at the connection point for the EUT (the end of the extension cable or power strip) with at least 0,8 m spacing between the EUT and the connection point on the extension cable.Where the EUT is a collection of equipment with multiple units, each having its own power cable, the point of connection for the AMN is determined by the following rules:\u2022 for an EUT that has several modules, each with its own power cable (however terminated) and for which the manufacturer provides a power strip (multi-socket mains splitter) with a single power cable for connection to the external power source, a single measurement shall be performed at the mains input to that power cable;\u2022 power cables or terminals which are not specified by the manufacturer to be connected via a host unit shall be measured separately;\u2022 power cables or field wiring terminals (mains input terminals) which are specified by the manufacturer to be connected via a host unit or other power-supplying equipment shall be connected as described by the manufacturer;\u2022 where a special connection is specified, the  necessary hardware to effect  the connection shall be supplied by the manufacturer for the purpose of this measurement.In all other cases the conducted emissions on each individual EUT with its own power cable that is terminated in a power supply plug of a standard design (IEC TR 60083 for example) shall be measured separately.Any AAN used during conducted emission measurements shall be selected and configured to be representative of the network in which the EUT is intended to operate. All ports of the AAN shall be correctly terminated in accordance with D.1. Where the 1 m requirement cannot be achieved, because of the position of the power input port/wired network port, then the effective length shall be as short as possible. In the case of EUTs including floor standing equipment the cable connecting the analogue/digital data port to the AAN may be positioned perpendicular to the EUT for a distance between of 0,3 m and 0,8 m then drop vertically to (but be insulated from) the horizontal RGP before being extended to the AAN. In these cases any bundling may be located on (but be insulated from) the ground plane", "D.2.2 Specific conditions for table-top equipmentThe RGP shall have a minimum size of 2 m by 2 m and shall extend a minimum of 0,5 m beyond the EUT, local AE and associated cabling in all directions.Alternative 1: The measurement shall be performed using a vertical RGP.

This configuration should then be used during formal measurements.The number of configurations to be considered is dependent upon the complexity of the EUT. Therefore, a quick and simple procedure should be established for comparative purposes so that the impact of varying the configuration can be found. Changes in configurations which may be considered include:\u2022 mode of operation, as defined in 3.1.23;\u2022 supply voltage discussed in A.1;\u2022 arrangement discussed in Annex D;\u2022 number and arrangement of modules within a system. See Figure 2;\u2022 number of cables attached applying the criteria in D.1.1;\u2022 position of cables, local AE and HID as required in Annex D.The prescan method attempts to closely emulate the formal procedure so that effective comparisons can be achieved. For example, a limited height SAC would be an appropriate prescan facility followed by an OATS/SAC for formal measurements. An effective prescan will give confidence that the configuration which produces the highest amplitude emission with respect to the limit has been found.Prescan measurements may be performed with spectrum analysers without pre-selection provided that precautions are used to ensure that the instrument is not overloaded.A simple procedure to check for overload is to repeat a measurement with an attenuator (for example, 6 dB) added at a convenient point in the measurement path so that the signal present at any active or nonlinear stage of the measurement path (amplifiers, limiters, receivers, and so forth) is reduced by a known amount. If the measured signal level does not decrease by approximately the value  of the attenuator used (within 0,5 dB),  then  the measurement system may be overloaded and steps should be taken to correct the problem.

This standardisation is necessary in order to obtain  reproducible measurement results, independent of the undefined asymmetric common mode impedance at the AE and the EUT.In general, the asymmetric common mode impedance seen by the EUT at the AE port is not defined unless an AAN is used. If the AE is located outside the shielded room, the asymmetric common mode impedance seen by the EUT at the AE port can be determined by the asymmetric common mode impedance of the feed through-filter between the measurement set-up and the outside world. A \u03c0-type filter has a low common mode impedance whilst a T- type filter has a high asymmetric common mode impedance.AANs do not exist for all types of cables used by MME. It is therefore also necessary to define other (non-invasive) measurement procedures that do not use AANs.Normally, there are several other cables (or ports) present at the EUT. At least the connection to the mains port is present in most cases. The asymmetric common mode impedance of these other connections (including a possible ground connection) and the presence or absence of these connections during the measurement can influence the measurement result significantly, particularly for small EUTs. Therefore the asymmetric common mode impedance of the non-measured connections has to be defined during the assessment of small EUTs. It is sufficient to have, in addition to the port being assessed, at  least two additional ports connected to a 150 \u2126 common mode impedance (normally by using an AAN with the RF\u2013 84 \u2013 CISPR 32:2015 \uf6d9 IEC 2015measurement port terminated with 50 \u2126) in order to reduce this influence to a negligible amount.Coupling devices for non-shielded balanced pairs should also simulate the typical LCL value of the lowest cabling category (worst LCL) specified for the wired network port being measured. The idea of this requirement is to take into account the transformation of the symmetrical signal into a asymmetric common mode signal, which might contribute to possible radiated disturbance when the EUT is used in the real application. Asymmetry in the AAN is deliberately introduced to yield the specified LCL value. This asymmetry may enhance or cancel the asymmetry of the EUT. In the interest of determining the worst case emissions and optimization of measurement repeatability, consideration should therefore be given  to repeating the measurement with the LCL imbalance on each wire of a balanced pair when using the appropriate AAN as defined in C.4.1.2.Since imbalance on each balanced pair will contribute to the total conducted common mode emission, all combinations of imbalance on all balanced pairs should be considered. For a single balanced pair, this has a relatively minor measurement impact \u2013 the two wires are reversed. However, for two balanced pairs, the number of LCL loading combinations (and therefore measurement configurations) is four. For four balanced pairs, the number of loading combinations grows to sixteen. Such numbers have a significant impact on measurement time and measurement documentation. Such measurements are not usually implemented, but if carried out the connection to AAN should be carefully documented.The RF measurement port of an AAN not connected to the measuring receiver should be terminated with 50 \u2126.", "Table G.1 \u2013  Summary of advantages and disadvantages of the procedures described in  C.4.1.6ProcedureC.4.1.6.2C.4.1.6.3C.4.1.6.4AdvantagesFor unscreened cablescontaining balanced pairs, theLCL values of the AAN are within the tolerance in Table C.2 of an AAN appropriate to the cablecategory connected to the EUT.

However, unless the asymmetric common mode impedance seenCISPR 32:2015 \uf6d9 IEC 2015 \u2013 85 \u2013by the EUT at the AE connection is 150 \u2126, the procedure in C.4.1.6.4 will show a result which is in general too high, but never too low (worst case estimation of the emission).", "G.2.3 Basic ideas of the CVPThe method described in C.4.1.6.4 uses a CVP to measure the asymmetric common mode voltage. There are two approaches to the construction of a CVP. For either approach, if a 150 \u2126 common mode impedance is present, the capacitance of the CVP to the cable attached to the EUT port being assessed will appear as a load in parallel with the 150 \u2126 common mode impedance.The common mode impedance tolerance is \u00b120 \u2126 over the frequency range of 0,15 MHz to 30 MHz. If the CVP loading is to reduce the 150 \u2126 common mode impedance down to no less than 130 \u2126, the capacitive loading of the CVP to the cable attached to the EUT port being assessed should be \u22645 pF at 30 MHz (the worst case frequency). At 30 MHz, the impedance of 5 pF is approximately 1 061 \u2126, which, in parallel with 150 \u2126 results in a combined common mode impedance of approximately 131,4 \u2126.A first possible CVP construction approach is for the probe to be a single capacitor that relies on physical distance from the cable attached to the EUT port being measured to achieve the <5 pF loading. This style of CVP is described in 5.2.2 of CISPR 16-1-2:2003/ AMD 1:2004/ AMD 2:2006.A second possible construction uses two coupling devices in series. A first capacitive coupling device in close proximity to the cable attached to the EUT port being assessed (the device is actually in physical contact with the insulation of the cable attached to the EUT port being assessed). The second device is a standard oscilloscope-type voltage probe having an impedance >10 M\u2126 with a probe capacitance <5 pF. The theory is that the probe capacitance in series with the capacitance of the capacitive coupling device presents only the probe capacitance to the cable attached to the EUT port being assessed. In practice, it is possible, given the physical size of the capacitive coupling device, to have a large stray capacitance in parallel with the probe capacitance. If this occurs, the total capacitive loading will be greater than that of the probe itself, and the requirement to have <5 pF loading may be violated. If this technique is employed, the capacitive loading should be verified by measurement and not rely on theory. This capacitance measurement can be made with any capacitance meter that can operate over the 0,15 MHz to 30 MHz frequency range. The capacitance is measured between the cable attached to the EUT port being assessed (all wires in the cable are connected together at the connection point to the meter) and the RGP. The same type of cable used in the conducted emissions measurement should be used for this capacitance measurement.NOTE This procedure has the lowest uncertainty if the length of cable between the EUT and AE is less than 1,25 m. Significantly longer cables are subject to standing waves that can adversely affect voltage and current measurements. For long cables where both the voltage and current limits cannot be met, changes to the measurement configuration can be implemented.", "G.2.4 Combination of current and voltage limitIf the common mode impedance is not 150 \u2126, the measurement of the voltage or the current alone is not acceptable because of a very high measurement uncertainty due to the undefined and unknown common mode impedances. If however both voltage and current are measured with current and voltage limits applied simultaneously, the result is a worst case estimation of the emission as explained below. The basic circuit for which the limit is defined is shown in Figure G.12.This circuit is the reference for which current and voltage limits are derived. Any other measurement has to be compared to this basic circuit. Z1 is an unknown parameter of the EUT. Z2 is 150 \u2126 in the reference measurement.\u2013 86 \u2013 CISPR 32:2015 \uf6d9 IEC 2015EUTZ1I Reference measurement with Z2 = 150 \u2126U0                                    U                                  Z2IEC", "Figure G.12 \u2013 Basic circuit for considering the limits with defined common mode impedance of 150 \u2126If the measurement is performed without defining the common mode impedance seen by the EUT, the simplified circuit is as shown in Figure G.12, where the common mode impedance Z2 seen by the EUT is defined by the AE and can have any value. Therefore Z1 as well as Z2 are unknown parameters of the measurement.EUT                                                              AEIZ1U0                                    U                                  Z2IEC", "Figure G.13 \u2013 Basic circuit for the measurement with unknown common mode impedanceIf the measurement is performed according to the circuit of Figure G.12 the limit of current and the limit of voltage are equivalent. The relation between current and voltage are always 150 \u2126 and either of the two can be used to determine the compliance with the limit. This is not the case if Z2 is not 150 \u2126. See Figure G.13.It is important to be aware that the source voltage U0 is not the only quantity determining the compliance with the limit. The disturbance voltage has to be measured at a standardized Z2 of 150 \u2126, while U in Figure G.13 depends on Z1, Z2, and U0 together. The limit value can be reached with an EUT containing a high impedance Z1 and a high source voltage U0, or with a lower U0 combined with a lower impedance Z1.In the more general case of Figure G.13 where Z2 is not defined, it is not possible to measure the exact value of the interference voltage. Since Z1 and U0 are not known, it is not possible to derive the interference voltage, even if the value of Z2 is known (or is measured or calculated from I and U). If for example an EUT, having excessive emissions, is measuredonly by determining the voltage in an arrangement with low Z2 (Z2  <150 \u2126) at the AE side, then the EUT might seem to comply with the limits. By contrast, if the same EUT is measured only by measuring the current in a measurement set-up with high Z2, (for example by addingferrites) the EUT might again seem to comply with the limits.CISPR 32:2015 \uf6d9 IEC 2015 \u2013 87 \u2013However, it can be shown that, if the current limit and the voltage limit are applied simultaneously, an EUT with emissions exceeding the limits is always discovered by exceeding either the current limit (if Z2 is <150 \u2126) or the voltage limit (if Z2 is >150 \u2126).If the common mode impedance of the AE (Z2) is far from 150 \u2126, it is possible that an EUT, which would comply with the limits if measured with Z2 = 150 \u2126, may be rejected. However an EUT not complying with the limits will never be accepted. The measurement according toC.4.1.6.4 is therefore a worst case estimation of the emission. If an EUT exceeds the limit with this procedure, it is possible the EUT would comply with the limits if it could be measuredwith Z2 = 150 \u2126. If emission measurements of the EUT by this procedure were compared to a power limit derived from the voltage and current limits, a more accurate measure of theinterference potential into 150 \u2126 is possible.", "G.2.5 Ferrite requirements for use in C.4.1.1Subclause C.4.1.6.3 defines  a measurement set-up for measuring the  common mode conducted emissions on the shield of a shielded cable. A 150 \u2126 load is specified to be connected between the cable shield and the RGP as described in C.4.1.6.3. Ferrites are shown placed over the cable shield between the 150 \u2126 load and the AE.

The ferrites are specified in C.4.1.6.3 to provide a high impedance such that \u201c\u2026the common mode impedance towards the right of the 150 \u2126 resistor shall be sufficiently large as to not affect the measurement.\u201d This impedance is shown in Figure G.14 as Zferrite in series withZaecm.The above quotation from C.4.1.6.3 infers that the combined series impedance of Zferrite andZaecm should not load down the 150 \u2126 resistor. The general approach in this standard for\u2013 88 \u2013 CISPR 32:2015 \uf6d9 IEC 2015tolerance on 150 \u2126 common mode loads is \u00b1 20 \u2126 over the frequency range of 0,15 MHz to 30 MHz. Combining these two concepts, the combined series impedance of Zferrite and Zaecm in parallel with the 150 \u2126 resistor (Z in Figure G.14) should be no lower than 130 \u2126. This in turn implies that this relationship should hold regardless of the value of Zaecm.This clause provides guidance on the use of ferrites in cause C.4.1.1.To establish the impedance characteristics of the ferrites, only two cases need to be considered: Zaecm = open circuit and Zaecm = short circuit. If the ferrites can be selected to satisfy these requirements, any value of Zaecm will be acceptable.\u2022 Case 1: Zaecm = open circuitThe combined series impedance of Zferrite and Zaecm is also an open circuit. An open circuit in parallel with the 150 \u2126 load is 150 \u2126. Zferrite can be of any value.\u2022 Case 2: Zaecm = short circuitThe combined series impedance of Zferrite and Zaecm is equal to Zferrite. The value of Zferrite in parallel with the 150 \u2126 resistor will then need to be no lower than 130 \u2126. In equation form:[(150)(Zferrite)]/(150 + Zferrite) \u2265 130  \u2126Solving for Zferrite yields a value of 975 \u2126.  This implies that the ferrites selected for this application should have a minimum impedance of 975 \u2126 over the frequency range of0,15 MHz to 30 MHz. For a given set of ferrites, the minimum impedance (j\u03c9L) will occur at the minimum frequency of 0,15 MHz.Combining the two cases cited above, it is seen that Case 2 at 0,15 MHz sets the minimum requirements for the impedance of ferrites so this value (or greater) would be acceptable.To determine whether  the selected ferrites will  accomplish the intended  function, the measurement set-up shown in Figure G.15 is suggested. A traditional impedance meter or analyser can be used to measure the impedance between point Z and the reference ground. Another approach is to measure the individual voltage and current at point Z (I and V in Figure G.15) and calculate the impedance. As a minimum, the impedance measurement should be made at 0,15 MHz. It would be advisable, however, to measure the impedance across the entire 0,15 MHz to 30 MHz range to ensure that no stray capacitance associated with the ferrites and the shielded cable degrades the ferrite impedance. This is of concern since laboratory data have shown that it is unlikely that desired impedance can be achieved with a single pass of the shielded cable through the ferrites. Multiple passes through the ferrites are necessary. This increases chances of stray capacitance adversely affecting the impedance of the ferrites. The capability to achieve the desired impedance versus frequency has been demonstrated in the laboratory.CISPR 32:2015 \uf6d9 IEC 2015 \u2013 89 \u2013Impedance meterCurrent probeCapacitive voltage probeFerritesI ZV150 \u2126Ref.

Therefore a suitable small transmit antenna shall be placed within the main beam axis of the EUT. The influence of the transmit antenna on the measurement result shall be reduced to a minimum. An example arrangement of the transmit antenna is shown in Figure H.2.The input signal shall be adjusted to get the maximum rated output level from the EUT.

At these frequencies the emissions can have very narrow beam widths and so the EUT needs to be rotated in order to ensure the maximum amplitude is found. Rotating of the EUT in 5 degree steps is recommended. In this case the maximum value of emission can be recorded for each position over the full swept frequency range.

For example, in the case of temperature requirements for surfaces on many appliances, generic standards, such as ISO 13732-1 for hot surfaces, are not applicable in addition to Part 1 or part 2 standards.Individual countries may wish to consider the application of the standard, as far as is reasonable, to appliances not mentioned in a part 2, and to appliances designed on new principles.An appliance that complies with the text of this standard will not necessarily be considered to comply with the safety principles of the standard if, when examined and tested, it is found to have other features which impair the level of safety covered by these requirements.An appliance employing materials or having forms of construction differing from those detailed in the requirements of this standard may be examined and tested according to the intent of the requirements and, if found to be substantially equivalent, may be considered to comply with the standard.NOTE 4 Standards dealing with non-safety aspects of household appliances areIEC standards published by TC 59 concerning methods of measuring performance;CISPR 11, CISPR 14-1, IEC 61000-3-2 and IEC 61000-3-3 concerning electromagnetic emissions;CISPR 14-2 concerning electromagnetic immunity;IEC standards published by TC 111 concerning environmental matters.60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010 \u2013 9 \u2013HOUSEHOLD AND SIMILAR ELECTRICAL APPLIANCES \u2013 SAFETY  \u2013Part 1: General requirementsScopeThis International Standard deals with the safety of electrical appliances for household and similar purposes, their rated voltage being not more than 250 V for single-phase appliances and 480 V for other appliances.NOTE 1 Battery-operated appliances and other d.c. supplied appliances are within the scope of this standard.Appliances not intended for normal household use but which nevertheless may be a source of danger to the public, such as appliances intended to be used by laymen in shops, in light industry and on farms, are within the scope of this standard.NOTE 2 Examples of such appliances are catering equipment, cleaning appliances for commercial use, and appliances for hairdressers.As far as is practicable, this standard  deals  with the  common hazards  presented by appliances that are encountered by all persons in and around the home. However, in general, it does not take into accountpersons (including children) whosephysical, sensory or mental capabilities; orlack of experience and knowledgeprevents them from using the appliance safely without supervision or instruction;children playing with the appliance.NOTE 3 Attention is drawn to the fact thatfor appliances intended to be used in vehicles or on board ships or aircraft, additional requirements may be necessary;in many countries, additional requirements are specified by the national health authorities, the national authorities responsible for the protection of labour, the national water supply authorities and similar authorities.NOTE 4 This standard does not apply toappliances intended exclusively for industrial purposes;appliances intended to be used in locations where special conditions prevail, such as the presence of a corrosive or explosive atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas);audio, video and similar electronic apparatus (IEC 60065);appliances for medical purposes (IEC 60601);hand-held motor-operated electric tools (IEC 60745);personal computers and similar equipment (IEC 60950-1);transportable motor-operated electric tools (IEC 61029).Normative referencesThe following referenced documents are indispensable for the application of this document.

The object of IEC is to promote international co-operation on all questions concerning standardization in the electrical and electronic fields. To this end and in addition to other activities, IEC publishes International Standards, Technical Specifications, Technical Reports, Publicly Available Specifications (PAS) and Guides (hereafter referred to as \u201cIEC Publication(s)\u201d). Their preparation is entrusted to technical committees; any IEC National Committee interested in the subject dealt with may participate in this preparatory work. International, governmental and non- governmental organizations liaising with the IEC also participate in this preparation. IEC collaborates closely with the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in accordance with conditions determined by agreement between the two organizations.The formal decisions or agreements of IEC on technical matters express, as nearly as possible, an international consensus of opinion on the relevant subjects since each technical committee has representation from all interested IEC National Committees.IEC Publications have the form of recommendations for international use and are accepted by IEC National Committees in that sense.

At this date, the publication will bereconfirmed,withdrawn,replaced by a revised edition, oramended.NOTE 3 The attention of National Committees is drawn to the fact that equipment manufacturers and testing organizations may need a transitional period following publication of a new, amended or revised IEC publication in which to make products in accordance with the new requirements and to equip themselves for conducting new or revised tests.It is the recommendation of the committee that the content of this publication be adopted for implementation nationally not earlier than 12 months or later than 36 months from the date of publication.60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010 \u2013 7 \u2013The following differences exist in the countries indicated below.Introduction: The Part 1 standard (UL60335-1) is only used in combination with a part 2 (UL60335-2-x).National differences are specified in these standards (USA).5.7: The ambient temperature is 25 \u00b0C \u00b1 10 \u00b0C (Japan).5.7: The ambient temperature is 27 \u00b0C \u00b1 5 \u00b0C (India).6.1: Class 0 appliances and class 0I appliances are not allowed (Australia, Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, India, Israel, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Singapore, Slovakia, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom).7.12.2: The requirements for full disconnection do not apply (Japan).13.2: The test circuit and some leakage current limits are different (India).22.2: The second paragraph of this subclause dealing with single-phase class I appliances with heating elements cannot be complied with because of the supply system (France and Norway).22.2: Double-pole switches or protective devices are required (Norway).22.35 Accessible metal parts separated from live parts by earthed metal parts are not regarded as likely to become live in the event of an insulation fault (USA).24.1: IEC component standard requirements are replaced by the relevant requirements of component standards specified in UL60335-1 and parts 2 (UL60335-2-x) (USA).25.3: A set of supply leads is not permitted (Norway, Denmark, Finland, Netherlands).25.8: 0,5 mm2 supply cords are not allowed for class I appliances (Australia and New Zealand).26.6: Conductor cross-sectional areas are different (USA).29.1: Different rated impulse voltages are used between 50 V and 150 V (Japan).\u2013 8 \u2013 60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010INTRODUCTIONIt has been assumed in the drafting of this International Standard that the execution of its provisions is entrusted to appropriately qualified and experienced persons.This standard recognizes the internationally accepted level of protection against hazards such as electrical, mechanical, thermal, fire and radiation of appliances when operated as in normal use taking into account the manufacturer's instructions. It also covers abnormal situations that  can  be expected  in practice  and takes  into account  the way in which electromagnetic phenomena can affect the safe operation of appliances.This standard takes into account the requirements of IEC 60364 as far as possible so that there is compatibility with the wiring rules when the appliance is connected to the supply mains. However, national wiring rules may differ.If the functions of an appliance are covered by different parts 2 of IEC 60335, the relevant part 2 is applied to each function separately, as far as is reasonable. If applicable, the influence of one function on the other is taken into account.NOTE 1 Throughout this publication, when \u201cPart 2\u201d is mentioned, it refers to the relevant part of IEC 60335.When a part 2 standard does not include additional requirements to cover hazards dealt with in Part 1, Part 1 applies.NOTE 2 This means that the technical committees responsible for the part 2 standards have determined that it is not necessary to specify particular requirements for the appliance in question over and above the general requirements.This standard is a product family standard dealing with the safety of appliances and takes precedence over horizontal and generic standards covering the same subject.NOTE 3 Horizontal and generic standards covering a hazard are not applicable since they have been taken into consideration when developing the general and particular requirements for the IEC 60335 series of standards. For example, in the case of temperature requirements for surfaces on many appliances, generic standards, such as ISO 13732-1 for hot surfaces, are not applicable in addition to Part 1 or part 2 standards.Individual countries may wish to consider the application of the standard, as far as is reasonable, to appliances not mentioned in a part 2, and to appliances designed on new principles.An appliance that complies with the text of this standard will not necessarily be considered to comply with the safety principles of the standard if, when examined and tested, it is found to have other features which impair the level of safety covered by these requirements.An appliance employing materials or having forms of construction differing from those detailed in the requirements of this standard may be examined and tested according to the intent of the requirements and, if found to be substantially equivalent, may be considered to comply with the standard.NOTE 4 Standards dealing with non-safety aspects of household appliances areIEC standards published by TC 59 concerning methods of measuring performance;CISPR 11, CISPR 14-1, IEC 61000-3-2 and IEC 61000-3-3 concerning electromagnetic emissions;CISPR 14-2 concerning electromagnetic immunity;IEC standards published by TC 111 concerning environmental matters.60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010 \u2013 9 \u2013HOUSEHOLD AND SIMILAR ELECTRICAL APPLIANCES \u2013 SAFETY  \u2013Part 1: General requirementsScopeThis International Standard deals with the safety of electrical appliances for household and similar purposes, their rated voltage being not more than 250 V for single-phase appliances and 480 V for other appliances.NOTE 1 Battery-operated appliances and other d.c. supplied appliances are within the scope of this standard.Appliances not intended for normal household use but which nevertheless may be a source of danger to the public, such as appliances intended to be used by laymen in shops, in light industry and on farms, are within the scope of this standard.NOTE 2 Examples of such appliances are catering equipment, cleaning appliances for commercial use, and appliances for hairdressers.As far as is practicable, this standard  deals  with the  common hazards  presented by appliances that are encountered by all persons in and around the home. However, in general, it does not take into accountpersons (including children) whosephysical, sensory or mental capabilities; orlack of experience and knowledgeprevents them from using the appliance safely without supervision or instruction;children playing with the appliance.NOTE 3 Attention is drawn to the fact thatfor appliances intended to be used in vehicles or on board ships or aircraft, additional requirements may be necessary;in many countries, additional requirements are specified by the national health authorities, the national authorities responsible for the protection of labour, the national water supply authorities and similar authorities.NOTE 4 This standard does not apply toappliances intended exclusively for industrial purposes;appliances intended to be used in locations where special conditions prevail, such as the presence of a corrosive or explosive atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas);audio, video and similar electronic apparatus (IEC 60065);appliances for medical purposes (IEC 60601);hand-held motor-operated electric tools (IEC 60745);personal computers and similar equipment (IEC 60950-1);transportable motor-operated electric tools (IEC 61029).Normative referencesThe following referenced documents are indispensable for the application of this document.

The test of 22.3 is carried out on a new appliance.NOTE 1 Additional samples may be required if the appliance has to be tested under different conditions, for example if it can be supplied with different voltages.If an intentionally weak part becomes open circuit during the tests of Clause 19, an additional appliance may be needed.The testing of components may require the submission of additional samples of these components. If the test of Annex C has to be carried out, six samples of the motor are needed.If the test of Annex D has to be carried out, an additional appliance may be used. If the tests of Annex G are carried out, four additional transformers are needed.If the tests of Annex H are carried out, three switches or three additional appliances are needed.NOTE 2 The cumulative stress resulting from successive tests on electronic circuits is to be avoided. It may be necessary to replace components or to use additional samples. The number of additional samples should be kept to a minimum by an evaluation of the relevant electronic circuits.NOTE 3 If an appliance has to be dismantled in order to carry out a test, care is to be taken to ensure that it is reassembled as originally supplied. In case of doubt, subsequent tests may be carried out on a separate sample.The tests are carried out in the order of the clauses. However, the test of 22.11 on the appliance at room temperature is carried out before the tests of Clause 8. The tests of Clause 14 and 21.2 and 22.24 are carried out after the tests of Clause 29. The test of 19.14 is carried out before the tests of 19.11.If it is evident from the construction of the appliance that a particular test is not applicable, the test is not carried out.When testing appliances that are also supplied by other energies such as gas, the influence of their consumption has to be taken into account.The tests are carried out with the appliance or any movable part of it placed in the most unfavourable position that may occur in normal use.Appliances provided with controls or switching devices are tested with these controls or devices adjusted to their most unfavourable setting, if the setting can be altered by the user.NOTE 1 If the adjusting means of the control is accessible without the aid of a tool, this subclause applies whether the setting can be altered by hand or with the aid of a tool. If the adjusting means is not accessible without the aid of a tool and if the setting is not intended to be altered by the user, this subclause does not apply.NOTE 2 Adequate sealing is regarded as preventing alteration of the setting by the user.\u2013 22 \u2013 60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010For appliances fitted with a voltage selector switch, unless otherwise specified, the tests are carried out with the switch in the position corresponding to the rated voltage value used for the tests.The tests are carried out in a draught-free location at an ambient temperature of 20 \u00b0C \u00b1 5 \u00b0C.If the temperature attained by any part is limited by a temperature sensitive device or is influenced by the temperature at which a change of state occurs, for example when water boils, the ambient temperature is maintained at 23 \u00b0C \u00b1 2 \u00b0C in case of doubt.Test conditions relating to frequency and voltageAppliances for a.c. only are tested with a.c. at rated frequency, and those for a.c. andd.c. are tested at the more unfavourable supply.Appliances for a.c. that are not marked with rated frequency or are marked with a rated frequency range of 50 Hz to 60 Hz are tested with either 50 Hz or 60 Hz, whichever is the more unfavourable.Appliances having more than one rated voltage are tested on the basis of the most unfavourable voltage.For motor-operated appliances, and combined appliances, marked with a rated voltage range, when it is specified that the supply voltage is equal to the rated voltage multiplied by a factor, the appliance is supplied atthe upper limit of the rated voltage range multiplied by this factor, if greater than 1;the lower limit of the rated voltage range multiplied by this factor, if smaller than 1.When a factor is not specified, the supply voltage is the most unfavourable within the rated voltage range.NOTE 1 If a heating appliance has a rated voltage range, the upper limit of the voltage range will usually be the most unfavourable voltage within the range.NOTE 2 For motor-operated appliances, combined appliances and appliances having more than one rated voltage or rated voltage range, it may be necessary to make some of the tests at the minimum, the mean and the maximum values of the rated voltage or the rated voltage range in order to establish the most unfavourable voltage.For heating appliances, and combined appliances, marked with a rated power input range, when it is specified that the power input is equal to the rated power input multiplied by a factor, the appliance is operated atthe upper limit of the rated power input range multiplied by this factor, if greater than 1;the lower limit of the rated power input range multiplied by this factor, if smaller than 1.When a factor is not specified, the power input is the most unfavourable within the rated power input range.For appliances  marked with  a rated voltage  range  and rated  power input corresponding to the mean of the rated voltage range, when it is specified that the power input is equal to rated power input multiplied by a factor, the appliance is operated atthe calculated power input corresponding to the upper limit of the rated voltage rangemultiplied by this factor, if greater than 1;60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010 \u2013 23 \u2013the calculated power input corresponding to the lower limit of the rated voltage rangemultiplied by this factor, if smaller than 1.When a factor is not specified, the power input corresponds to the power input at the most unfavourable voltage within the rated voltage range.When alternative heating elements or accessories are made available by the appliance manufacturer, the appliance is tested with those elements or accessories which give the most unfavourable results.The tests are carried out on the  appliance as supplied. However,  an appliance constructed as a single appliance but supplied in a number of units is tested after assembly in accordance with the instructions provided with the appliance.Built-in appliances and fixed appliances are installed in accordance with the instructions provided with the appliance before testing.Appliances intended to be connected to fixed wiring by means of a flexible cord are tested with the appropriate flexible cord connected to the appliance.For heating appliances and combined appliances, when it is specified that the appliance has to operate at a power input multiplied by a factor, this applies only to heating elements without appreciable positive temperature coefficient of resistance.For heating elements with appreciable positive temperature coefficient of resistance, other than PTC heating elements, the supply voltage is determined by supplying the appliance at rated voltage until the heating element reaches its operating temperature. The supply voltage is then rapidly increased to the value necessary to give the power input required for the relevant test, this value of the supply voltage being maintained throughout the test.NOTE In general, the temperature coefficient is considered to be appreciable if, at rated voltage, the power input of the appliance in cold condition differs by more than 25 % from the power input at operating temperature.The tests for appliances with PTC heating elements and for heating appliances and combined appliances where the heating elements are supplied via a switch mode power supply are carried out at a voltage corresponding to the specified power input.When a power input greater than the rated power input is specified, the factor for multiplying the voltage is equal to the square root of the factor for multiplying the power input.If class 0I appliances or class I appliances have accessible metal parts that are not earthed and are not separated from live parts by an intermediate metal part that is earthed, such parts are checked for compliance with the appropriate requirements specified for class II construction.If class 0I appliances or class I appliances have accessible non-metallic parts, such parts are checked for compliance with the appropriate requirements specified for class II construction unless these parts are separated from live parts by an intermediate metal part that is earthed.NOTE Guidance is given in Annex P for enhanced requirements that may be used to ensure an acceptable level of protection against electrical and thermal hazards for particular types of appliances used in an installation without a protective earthing conductor in countries that have warm damp equable climates.If appliances have parts operating at safety extra-low voltage, such parts are checked for compliance with the appropriate requirements specified for class III construction.\u2013 24 \u2013 60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010When testing electronic circuits, the supply is to be free from perturbations from external sources that can influence the results of the tests.Appliances powered by rechargeable batteries are tested in accordance with Annex B.If linear and angular dimensions are specified without a tolerance, ISO 2768-1 is applicable.If a component or part of the appliance has both a self resetting feature and a non- self-resetting feature and if the non-self-resetting feature is not required in order to comply with the standard, then appliances incorporating such a component or part shall be tested with the non-self-resetting feature rendered inoperative.", "Appliances shall be of one of the following classes with respect to protection against electric shock:class 0, class 0I, class I, class II, class III.Compliance is checked by inspection and by the relevant tests.Appliances shall have the appropriate degree of protection against harmful ingress of water.Compliance is checked by inspection and by the relevant tests.NOTE The degrees of protection against harmful ingress of water are given in IEC 60529.", "Appliances shall be marked with therated voltage or rated voltage range in volts;symbol for nature of supply, unless the rated frequency is marked;rated power input in watts or rated current in amperes;name, trade mark or identification mark of the manufacturer or responsible vendor;model or type reference;symbol IEC 60417-5172 (2003-02) for class II appliances only;IP number according to degree of protection against ingress of water, other than IPX0;symbol IEC 60417-5180 (2003-02), for class  III appliances. This marking  is not necessary for appliances that are operated only by batteries  (primary batteries  or secondary batteries that are recharged outside of the appliance).NOTE 1 The first numeral of the IP number need not be marked on the appliance.NOTE 2 Additional markings are allowed provided they do not give rise to misunderstanding.NOTE 3 If components are marked separately, the marking of the appliance and that of the components is to be such that there can be no doubt with regard to the marking of the appliance itself.NOTE 4 If the appliance is marked with rated pressure, the units used may be bars but only together with pascals and placed in brackets.60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010 \u2013 25 \u2013The enclosure of electrically-operated water valves incorporated in external hose-sets for connection of an appliance to the water mains shall be marked with symbol IEC 60417-5036 (2002-10) if their working voltage exceeds extra-low voltage.Compliance is checked by inspection.Stationary appliances for multiple supply shall be marked with the substance of the following:Warning: Before obtaining access to terminals, all supply circuits must be disconnected.This warning shall be placed in the vicinity of the terminal cover.Compliance is checked by inspection.Appliances having  a range  of rated  values  and which can be operated without adjustment throughout the range shall be marked with the lower and upper limits of the range separated by a hyphen.NOTE 1 Example: 115-230 V: The appliance is suitable for any value within the marked range (a curling iron with a PTC heating element or an appliance incorporating an input switch mode power supply).Appliances having different rated values and which have to be adjusted for use at a particular value by the user or installer shall be marked with the different values separated by an oblique stroke.NOTE 2 Example: 115/230 V: The appliance is only suitable for the marked values (a shaver with a selector switch).NOTE 3 This requirement is also applicable to appliances with provision for connection to both single-phase and multi-phase supplies.Example: 230 V/400 V: The appliance is only suitable for the voltage values indicated, 230 V being for single- phase operation and 400 V for three-phase operation (a dishwasher with terminals for both supplies).Compliance is checked by inspection.If the appliance can be adjusted for different rated voltages, the voltage to which the appliance is adjusted shall be clearly discernible. If frequent changes in voltage setting are not required, this requirement is considered to  be met if the rated voltage to which the appliance is to be adjusted can be determined from a wiring diagram fixed to the appliance.NOTE The wiring diagram may be on the inside of a cover that has to be removed to connect the supply conductors. It is not to be on a label loosely attached to the appliance.Compliance is checked by inspection.For appliances marked with more than one rated voltage or with one or more rated voltage ranges, the rated power input or rated current for each of these voltages or ranges shall be marked.

The temperature rise of the cord sheath is determined as near as possible to the hub of the reel and also between the two outermost layers of the cord on the reel.For cord  storage devices, other  than  automatic cord  reels,  which  are intended to accommodate the supply cord partially while the appliance is in operation, 50 cm of the cord is unwound. The temperature rise of the stored part of the cord is determined at the most unfavourable place.Temperature rises, other than those of windings, are determined by means of fine-wire thermocouples positioned so that they have minimum effect on the temperature of the part under test.NOTE 1 Thermocouples having wires with a diameter not exceeding 0,3 mm are considered to be fine-wire thermocouples.Thermocouples used for determining the temperature rise of the surface of walls, ceiling and floor of the test corner are attached to the back of small blackened disks of copper or brass, 15 mm in diameter and 1 mm thick. The front of the disk is flush with the surface of the board.As far as is possible, the appliance is positioned so that the thermocouples detect the highest temperatures.The temperature rise of electrical insulation, other than that of windings, is determined on the surface of the insulation at places where failure could causea short circuit;contact between live parts and accessible metal parts;bridging of insulation;a reduction of clearances  or creepage distances below the values  specified in Clause 29.NOTE 2 If it is necessary to dismantle the appliance to position thermocouples, care has to be taken to ensure that the appliance has been correctly reassembled. In case of doubt, the power input is remeasured.NOTE 3 The point of separation of the cores of a multicore cord and the point where insulated wires enter lampholders are examples of places where thermocouples are positioned.Temperature rises of windings are determined by the resistance method unless the windings are  non-uniform or if it is difficult to make the necessary connections, in which case the temperature rise is determined by means of thermocouples. At the beginning of the test, the windings are to be at room temperature.\u2013 36 \u2013 60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010The temperature rise of a winding is calculated from the formula:\u0394t =R2 \u2212 R1 R1(k + t1) \u2013 (t2 \u2013 t1)where\u0394t is the temperature rise of the winding;R1 is the resistance at the beginning of the test; R2 is the resistance at the end of the test;k is equal to225 for aluminium windings and copper/aluminium windings with an aluminium content\u2265 85 %,229,75 for copper/aluminium windings with an copper content > 15 % to < 85 %,234,5 for copper windings and copper/aluminium windings with an copper content\u2265 85 %;t1 is the room temperature at the beginning of the test; t2 is the room temperature at the end of the test.NOTE 4 It is recommended that the resistance of windings at the end of the test be determined by taking resistance measurements as soon as possible after switching off and then at short intervals so that a curve of resistance against time can be plotted for ascertaining the resistance at the instant of switching off.Heating appliances are operated under normal operation and at 1,15 times rated power input.Motor-operated appliances are operated under normal operation and supplied with the most unfavourable voltage between 0,94 times and 1,06 times the rated voltage.Combined appliances are operated under normal operation and supplied with the most unfavourable voltage between 0,94 times and 1,06 times the rated voltage.The appliance is operated for a duration corresponding to the most unfavourable conditions of normal use.NOTE The duration of the test may consist of more than one cycle of operation.During the test, the temperature rises are monitored continuously and shall not exceed the values shown in Table 3. The temperature rise limit for metal applies to parts having a metal coating at least 0,1 mm thick and to metal parts having a plastic coating less than 0,3 mm thick.If the temperature rise of the motor winding exceeds the value specified in Table 3 or if there is doubt with regard to the temperature classification of the insulation of the motor, the tests of Annex C are carried out.Protective devices shall not operate and sealing compound shall not flow out.

However, the temperature rise values specified are based on 25 \u00b0C.NOTE 3 The temperature of the terminals of switches is measured if the switch is tested in accordance with Annex H.a To allow for the fact that the average temperature of windings of universal motors, relays, solenoids and similar components is usually above the temperature at the points on the windings where thermocouples are placed, the figures without parentheses apply when the resistance method is used and those within parentheses apply when thermocouples are used. For windings of vibrator coils and a.c. motors, the figures without parentheses apply in both cases.The temperature rise limit of windings in transformers and inductors mounted on printed circuit boards is equal to the thermal class of the winding insulation reduced by 25 K provided the largest dimension of the winding does not exceed 5 mm in cross section or length.For motors constructed so that the circulation of air between the inside and the outside of the case is prevented but which are not necessarily sufficiently enclosed to be considered airtight, the temperature rise limits may be increased by 5 K.b T means the maximum ambient temperature in which the component or its switch head can operate.The ambient is the temperature of the air at the hottest point at a distance of 5 mm from the surface of the component concerned. However, if a thermostat or a temperature limiter is mounted on a heat-conducting part, the declared temperature limit of the mounting surface (Ts) is also applicable. Therefore, the temperature rise of the mounting surface has to be measured.The temperature rise limit does not apply to switches or controls tested in accordance with the conditions occurring in the appliance.c This limit may be exceeded if the instruction specified in 7.12.3 is supplied.d Locations for measuring the temperature rises are specified in Table 12.1 of IEC 60598-1.e The values in parentheses apply to locations where the part is fixed to a hot surface.f There is no specific limit for thermoplastic material. However, the temperature rise has to be determined in order that the tests of 30.1 can be carried out.g The limit specified concerns the deterioration of wood and it does not take into account deterioration of surface finishes.h There is no limit for the temperature rise of capacitors that are short-circuited in 19.11.i Temperature marking for capacitors mounted on printed circuit boards may be given in the technical sheet.j IEC 60245 Types 53 and 57 supply cords have a T rating of 60 \u00b0C; IEC 60245 Type 88 supply cords have a T rating of 70 \u00b0C;IEC 60227 Types 52 and 53 supply cords have a T rating of 70 \u00b0C; IEC 60227 Types 56 and 57 supply cords have a T rating of 90 \u00b0C.", "At operating temperature, the leakage current of the appliance shall not be excessive and its electric strength shall be adequate.Compliance is checked by the tests of 13.2 and 13.3.The appliance is operated under normal operation for the duration specified in 11.7.Heating appliances are operated at 1,15 times the rated power input.\u2013 40 \u2013 60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010Motor-operated appliances and combined appliances are supplied at 1,06 times rated voltage.Three-phase appliances, which according to the instructions for installation are also suitable for single-phase supply, are tested as single-phase appliances with the three circuits connected in parallel.Protective impedance and radio interference filters are disconnected before carrying out the tests.For class 0 appliances, class II appliances and class III appliances, the leakage current is measured by means of the circuit described in Figure 4 of IEC 60990. For other appliances, a low impedance ammeter capable of measuring the true r.m.s. value of  the leakage current may be used.The leakage current is measured between any pole of the supply and accessible metal parts connected to metal foil having an area not exceeding 20 cm \u00d7 10 cm which is in contact with accessible surfaces of insulating materials.The metal foil has the largest area possible on the surface under test without exceeding the dimensions specified. If its area is smaller than the surface under test, it is moved to test all parts of the surface. The heat dissipation of the appliance is not to be affected by the metal foil.For single-phase appliances, the measuring circuit is shown in the following figures:if of class II, Figure 1;if other than class II, Figure 2.The leakage current is measured with the selector switch in each of the positions a and b.For three-phase appliances, the measuring circuit is shown in the following figures:if of class II, Figure 3;if other than class II, Figure 4.For three-phase appliances, the leakage current is measured with the switches a, b and c in the closed position.

The overload release of the circuit is not to be operated by any current below thetripping current Ir. The values of Is and Ir are given in Table 5 for various high-voltage sources.The test voltage is applied between live parts and accessible parts, non-metallic parts being covered with metal foil.

The heat dissipation of the appliance is not to be affected by the metal foil.For single-phase appliances, the measuring circuit is shown in the following figures:if of class II, Figure 1;if other than class II, Figure 2.The leakage current is measured with the selector switch in each of the positions a and b.For three-phase appliances, the measuring circuit is shown in the following figures:if of class II, Figure 3;if other than class II, Figure 4.For three-phase appliances, the leakage current is measured with the switches a, b and c in the closed position. The measurements are then repeated with each of the switches a, b and c open in turn, the other two switches remaining closed. For appliances intended to be connected in star connection only, the neutral is not connected.After the appliance has been operated for a duration as specified in 11.7, the leakage current shall not exceed the following values:for class II appliances 0,35 mA peakfor class 0 and class III appliances 0,7 mA peakfor class 0I appliances 0,5 mAfor portable class I appliances 0,75 mAfor stationary class I motor-operated appliances 3,5 mAfor stationary class I heating appliances 0,75 mA or 0,75 mA per kW ratedpower input of the appliance with a maximum of 5 mA, whichever  is higher60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010 \u2013 41 \u2013For combined appliances, the total leakage current may be within the limits specified for heating appliances or motor-operated appliances, whichever is the greater, but the two limits are not added.If the appliance incorporates capacitors and is provided with a single-pole switch, the measurements are repeated with the switch in the off position.If the appliance incorporates a thermal control which operates during the test of Clause 11, the leakage current is measured immediately before the control opens the circuit.NOTE 1 The test with the switch in the off position is carried out to verify that capacitors connected behind a single-pole switch do not cause an excessive leakage current.NOTE 2 It is recommended that the appliance is supplied through an isolating transformer; otherwise it is to be insulated from earth.The appliance is disconnected from the supply and the insulation is immediately subjected to a voltage having a frequency of 50 Hz or 60 Hz for 1 min, in accordance with IEC 61180-1.The high-voltage source used for the test is to be capable of supplying a short circuit current Is between the output terminals after the output voltage has been adjusted to the appropriate test voltage. The overload release of the circuit is not to be operated by any current below thetripping current Ir. The values of Is and Ir are given in Table 5 for various high-voltage sources.The test voltage is applied between live parts and accessible parts, non-metallic parts being covered with metal foil. For class II constructions having intermediate metal between live parts and  accessible parts, the  voltage is applied across  the basic insulation  and  the supplementary insulation.NOTE 1 Care should be taken to avoid overstressing the components of electronic circuits.The values of the test voltages are specified in Table 4.Table 4 \u2013 Voltage for electric  strength testInsulationTest voltageVRated voltage aWorking voltage (U)SELV\u2264150 V>150 V and \u2264250 V b>250 VBasic insulation5001 0001 0001,2 U + 700Supplementary insulation1 2501 7501,2 U + 1 450Reinforced insulation2 5003 0002,4 U + 2 400a For multi-phase appliances, the line to neutral or  line  to  earth voltage  is  used  for  rated  voltage.

It is supplied from a generator having a conventional output impedance not exceeding 42 \u03a9. The impulse test voltage is applied three times for eachpolarity with intervals of at least 1 s.NOTE 1 The generator is specified in IEC 61180-2.The impulse test voltage is specified in Table 6 for rated impulse voltages given in Table 15.Table 6 \u2013 Impulse test  voltageRated impulse voltageVImpulse test voltageV3303575005408009301 5001 7502 5002 9204 0004 9206 0007 3808 0009 84010 00012 300There shall be no flashover. However, flashover of functional insulation is allowed if the appliance complies with Clause 19 when the clearance is short-circuited.NOTE 2 The impulse test voltages have been calculated using correction factors for testing at locations situated at sea level. It is considered that they are appropriate for any location between sea level and 500 m. If tests are carried out at other locations, other correction factors should be used as noted in Subclause 6.1.2.2.1.3 of IEC 60664-1.60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010 \u2013 43 \u2013Moisture resistanceThe enclosure of the appliance shall provide the degree of protection against moisture in accordance with the classification of the appliance.Compliance is checked as specified in 15.1.1 taking into account 15.1.2, the appliance not being connected to the supply mains.The appliance shall then withstand the electric strength test of 16.3 and, after carefully wiping the external enclosure to remove any surplus water, an inspection shall show that there is no trace of water on insulation which could result in a reduction of clearances or creepage distances below the values specified in Clause 29.NOTE Care has to be taken when dismantling to avoid displacing any water within the appliance.Appliances other than those classified IPX0 are subjected to the tests of IEC 60529 as follows:IPX1 appliances as described in Subclause 14.2.1;IPX2 appliances as described in Subclause 14.2.2;IPX3 appliances as described in Subclause 14.2.3a;\u2212 IPX4 appliances as described in Subclause 14.2.4a;IPX5 appliances as described in Subclause 14.2.5;IPX6 appliances as described in Subclause 14.2.6;\u2013 IPX7 appliances as described in Subclause 14.2.7. For this test the appliance is immersed in water containing approximately 1 % NaCl.NOTE The hand-held spray nozzle may be used for testing appliances that cannot be placed under the oscillating tube specified in IEC 60529.Water valves containing live parts and that are incorporated in external hoses for connection of an appliance to the water mains are subjected to the test specified for IPX7 appliances.Hand-held appliances are turned continuously through  the most unfavourable positions during the test.Built-in appliances are installed in accordance with the instructions.Appliances normally used on the floor or table are placed on a horizontal unperforated support having a diameter of twice the oscillating tube radius minus 15 cm.Appliances normally fixed to a wall and appliances with pins for insertion into socket-outlets are mounted as in normal use in the centre of a wooden board having dimensions which are 15 cm \u00b1 5 cm in excess of those of the orthogonal projection of the appliance on the board. The wooden board is placed at the centre of the oscillating tube.For IPX3 appliances, the base of wall-mounted appliances is placed at the same level as the pivot axis of the oscillating tube.For IPX4 appliances, the horizontal centre line of the appliance is aligned with the pivot axis of the oscillating tube. However, for appliances normally used on the floor or table, the movement is limited to two times 90\u00b0 from the vertical for a period of 5 min, the support being placed at the level of the pivot axis of the oscillating tube.\u2013 44 \u2013 60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010If the instructions for wall-mounted appliances state that the appliance is to be placed close to the floor level and specifies a distance, a board is placed under the appliance at that distance. The dimensions of the board are 15 cm more than the horizontal projection of the appliance.Appliances normally fixed to a ceiling are mounted underneath a horizontal unperforated support that is constructed to prevent water spraying onto its top surface. The pivot axis of the oscillating tube is located at the same level as the underside of the support and aligned centrally with  the  appliance. The spray  is directed upwards.  For IPX4  appliances, the movement of the tube is limited to two times 90\u00ba from the vertical for a period of 5 min.Appliances with type X attachment, except those having a specially prepared cord, are fitted with the lightest permissible type of flexible cord of the smallest cross-sectional area specified in Table 13.Detachable parts are removed and subjected, if necessary, to the relevant treatment with the main part. However, if the instructions state  that a part has to be removed  for user maintenance and a tool is needed, this part is not removed.Appliances subject to spillage of liquid in normal use shall be constructed so that such spillage does not affect their electrical insulation.Compliance is checked by the following test.Appliances with type X attachment, except those having a specially prepared cord, are fitted with the lightest permissible type of flexible cord of the smallest cross-sectional area specified in Table 13.Appliances incorporating an appliance inlet are tested with or without  an appropriate connector in position, whichever is most unfavourable.Detachable parts are removed.The liquid container of the appliance is completely filled with water containing approximately 1 % NaCl and a further quantity, equal to 15 % of the capacity of the container or 0,25 l, whichever is the greater, is poured in steadily over a period of 1 min.The appliance shall then withstand the electric strength test of 16.3 and inspection shall show that there is no trace of water on insulation that could result in a reduction of clearances or creepage distances below the values specified in Clause 29.Appliances shall be proof against humid conditions that may occur in normal use.Compliance is checked by test Cab: Damp heat steady state in IEC 60068-2-78 under the following conditions.Appliances that were subjected to the tests of 15.1 or 15.2 are placed in normal ambient conditions for 24 h.Cable entries, if any, are left open. If knock-outs are provided, one of them is opened. Detachable parts are removed and subjected, if necessary, to the humidity test with the main part.The humidity test is carried out for 48 h in a humidity cabinet containing air with a relative humidity of (93 \u00b1 3) %. The temperature of the air is maintained within 2 K of any convenient60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010 \u2013 45 \u2013value t between 20 \u00b0C and 30 \u00b0C. Before being placed in the humidity cabinet, the appliance0is brought to a temperature of t +4\u00b0C.NOTE If it is not possible to place the whole appliance in the humidity cabinet, parts containing electrical insulation may be tested separately, taking into account the conditions that the electrical insulation is subjected to within the appliance.The appliance shall then withstand the tests of Clause 16 in the humidity cabinet or in the room in which the appliance was brought to the prescribed temperature after reassembly of those parts that may have been removed.Leakage current and electric strengthThe leakage current of the appliance shall not be excessive and its electric strength shall be adequate.Compliance is checked by the tests of 16.2 and 16.3.Protective impedance is disconnected from live parts before carrying out the tests.The tests are carried out on the appliance at room temperature and not connected to the supply mains.An a.c. test voltage is applied between live parts and accessible metal parts that are connected to metal foil having an area not exceeding 20 cm \u00d7 10 cm in contact with accessible surfaces of insulating materials.The test voltage is1,06 times rated voltage, for single-phase appliances;1,06 times rated voltage, divided by 3 , for three-phase appliances.The leakage current is measured within 5 s after the application of the test voltage.

They are also doubled ifthe appliance has no control other than a thermal cut-out, orall thermostats, temperature limiters and energy regulators do not have an off position, orthe appliance has radio interference filters. In this case, the leakage current with the filter disconnected shall not exceed the limits specified.\u2013 46 \u2013 60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010For combined appliances, the total leakage current may be within the limits specified for heating appliances or motor-operated appliances, whichever is the greater, but the two limits are not added.For measuring the leakage current, a low impedance ammeter capable of measuring the truer.m.s. value of current may be used.Immediately after the test of 16.2, the insulation is subjected to a voltage having a frequency of 50 Hz or 60 Hz for 1 min in accordance with IEC 61180-1. The values of the test voltage for different types of insulation are given in Table 7.Accessible parts of insulating material are covered with metal foil.NOTE 1 Care is to be taken that the metal foil is placed so that no flashover occurs at the edges of the insulation.Table 7 \u2013 Test voltagesInsulationTest voltageVRated voltage aWorking voltage (U)SELV\u2264150 V>150Vand \u2264250Vb>250 VBasic insulation cSupplementary insulation cReinforced insulation500\u2013\u20131122502505001132507500001,21,22,4U UU+++12950450400a For multi-phase appliances, the line to neutral or line to earth voltage is used for rated voltage. The test voltage for 480 V multi-phase appliances is that specified for a rated voltage in the range> 150 V and \u2264 250 V.b For appliances having a rated voltage \u2264150 V, these test voltages apply to parts  having  a  working  voltage > 150 V and \u2264 250 V.c In constructions where basic insulation  and  supplementary insulation  cannot  be  tested separately,  the insulation is subjected to the test voltages specified for reinforced insulation.A test voltage is applied between accessible metal parts and the supply cord which is wrapped with metal foil at the point where the supply cord is located in an inlet bushing and where, for appliances having a type X attachment, the supply cord is located in a cord guard or a cord anchorage with their clamping screws, if any, being tightened to two-thirds of the torque specified in Table 14. The test voltage is 1 250 V for class 0 appliances and class I appliances and 1 750 V for class II appliances.NOTE 2 The characteristics of the high-voltage source used for the test are described in Table 5.NOTE 3 For class II constructions incorporating both reinforced insulation and double insulation, care is to be taken that the voltage applied to the reinforced insulation does not overstress the basic insulation or the supplementary insulation.NOTE 4 When testing insulating coatings, the metal foil may be pressed against the insulation by means of a sandbag so that the pressure is approximately 5 kPa. The test may be limited to places where the insulation is likely to be weak, for example where there are sharp metal edges under the insulation.NOTE 5 If practicable, insulating linings should be tested separately.NOTE 6 Care is to be taken to avoid overstressing the components of electronic circuits.No breakdown shall occur during the test.60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010 \u2013 47 \u2013", "Appliances incorporating circuits supplied from a transformer shall be constructed so that in the event of short circuits which are likely to occur in normal use, excessive temperatures do not occur in the transformer or in the circuits associated with the transformer.NOTE Examples are the short-circuiting of bare or inadequately insulated conductors of accessible circuitsoperating at safety extra-low voltage.Compliance is checked by applying the most unfavourable short circuit or overload which is likely to occur in normal use, the appliance being supplied with 1,06 times or 0,94 times rated voltage, whichever is the more unfavourable. Basic insulation is not short circuited.The temperature rise of the insulation of the conductors of safety extra-low voltage circuits shall not exceed the relevant value specified in Table 3 by more than 15 K.The temperature of windings shall not exceed the values specified in Table 8. However, these limits do not apply to fail-safe transformers complying with Subclause 15.5 of IEC 61558-1.", "NOTE Requirements and tests are specified in part 2 when necessary.", "Appliances shall be constructed so that as a result of abnormal or careless operation, the risk of fire, mechanical damage impairing safety or protection against electric shock is obviated as far as is practicable.Electronic circuits shall be designed and applied so that a fault condition will not render the appliance unsafe with regard to electric shock, fire hazard, mechanical hazard or dangerous malfunction.Appliances incorporating heating elements are subjected to the tests of 19.2 and 19.3. In addition, such appliances having a control that limits the temperature during the test of Clause 11 are subjected to the tests of 19.4 and, when applicable, to the test of 19.5. Appliances incorporating PTC heating elements are also subjected to the test of 19.6.Appliances incorporating motors are subjected to the tests of 19.7 to 19.10, as applicable.Appliances incorporating electronic circuits are also subjected to the tests of 19.11 and 19.12, as applicable.Appliances incorporating contactors or relays are subjected to the test of 19.14. Appliances incorporating voltage selector switches are subjected to the test of 19.15.Unless otherwise specified, the tests are continued until a non-self-resetting thermal cut- out operates or until steady conditions are established. If a heating element or an intentionally weak part becomes permanently open-circuited, the relevant test is repeated on a second sample. This second test shall be terminated in the same mode unless the test is otherwise satisfactorily completed.NOTE Fuses, thermal cut-outs, overcurrent protection devices, or similar devices incorporated in the appliance, may be used to provide the necessary protection. The protective device in the fixed wiring does not provide the necessary protection.\u2013 48 \u2013 60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010Unless otherwise specified, only one abnormal condition is simulated at any one time.If more than one of the tests are applicable to the same appliance, these tests are carried out consecutively after the appliance has cooled down to room temperature.For combined appliances, the tests are carried out with motors and heating elements operating simultaneously under normal operation, the appropriate tests being applied one at a time to each motor and heating element.When it is stated that a control is short-circuited, it may be rendered inoperative instead.Unless otherwise specified, compliance with the tests of this clause is checked as described in 19.13.Appliances with heating  elements  are tested  under the conditions  specified  in Clause 11 but with restricted heat dissipation. The supply voltage, determined prior to the test, is that required to provide a power input of 0,85 times rated power input under normal operation when the power input has stabilized. This voltage is maintained throughout the test.NOTE Controls that operate during the test of Clause 11 are allowed to operate.The test of 19.2 is repeated but with a supply voltage, determined prior to the test, equal to that required to provide a power input of 1,24 times rated power input under normal operation when the power input has stabilized. This voltage is maintained throughout the test.NOTE Controls that operate during the test of Clause 11 are allowed to operate.The appliance is tested under the conditions specified in Clause 11. Any control that limits the temperature during the test of Clause 11 is short-circuited.If the appliance incorporates more than one control, they are short-circuited in turn.The test of 19.4 is repeated on class  0I appliances and class I appliances incorporating tubular sheathed or embedded heating elements. However, controls are not short-circuited but one end of the element is connected to the sheath of the heating element.This test is repeated with the polarity of the supply to the appliance reversed and with the other end of the element connected to the sheath.The test is not carried out on appliances intended to be permanently connected to fixed wiring and on appliances where an all-pole disconnection occurs during the test of 19.4.Appliances with a neutral are tested with the neutral connected to the sheath.NOTE For embedded heating elements, the metal enclosure is considered to be the sheath.Appliances with PTC heating elements are supplied at rated voltage until steady conditions with regard to power input and temperature are established.The working voltage of the PTC heating element is increased by 5 % and the appliance is operated until steady conditions are re-established. The voltage is then increased in similar steps until 1,5 times working voltage is reached, or until the PTC heating element ruptures, whichever occurs first.60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010 \u2013 49 \u2013The appliance is operated under stalled conditions bylocking the rotor of appliances for which the locked rotor torque is smaller than the full load torque;locking moving parts of other appliances.If an appliance has more than one motor, the test is carried out for each motor separately.Appliances incorporating motors and having capacitors in the circuit of an auxiliary winding, are operated with the rotor locked, the capacitors being open-circuited one at a time. The test is repeated with the capacitors short-circuited one at a time, unless they are of class P2 of IEC 60252-1.NOTE 1 This test is carried out with the rotor locked since some motors may start thus giving rise to inconsistent results.For each of the tests, appliances provided with a timer or programmer are supplied at rated voltage for a period equal to the maximum period allowed by the timer or programmer.Other appliances are supplied at rated voltage for a periodof 30 s forhand-held appliances,appliances that have to be kept switched on by hand or foot, andappliances that are continuously loaded by hand;of 5 min for other appliances that are operated while attended;until steady conditions are established, for other appliances.NOTE 2 Appliances that are tested for 5 min are indicated in the relevant part 2.During the test, the temperature of the windings shall not exceed the relevant value specified in Table 8.Table 8 \u2013 Maximum winding temperatureType of applianceTemperature\u00b0CClass 105 (A)Class 120 (E)Class 130 (B)Class 155 (F)Class 180 (H)Class 200 (N)Class 220 (R)Class 250Appliances other than those operated until steady conditions are established200215225240260280300330Appliances operated until steady conditions are established150165175190210230250280200215225240260280300330175190200215235255275305150165175190210230250280if impedance protectedif protected by a protective deviceduring the first hour, maximum valueafter the first hour, maximum valueafter the first hour, arithmetic averageOne phase of appliances incorporating multi-phase motors is disconnected. The appliance is then operated under normal operation and supplied at rated voltage for the period specified in 19.7.\u2013 50 \u2013 60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010A running overload test is carried out on appliances incorporating motors that are intended to be remotely or automatically controlled or liable to be operated continuously.Motor-operated appliances  and combined appliances for which  Subclause  30.2.3  is applicable and that use overload protective devices relying on electronic circuits to protect the motor windings, other than those that sense winding temperatures directly, are also subjected to the running overload test.The appliance is operated under normal operation and supplied at rated voltage until steady conditions are established. The load is then increased so that the current through the motor windings is raised by 10 % and the appliance is operated again until steady conditions are established, the supply voltage being maintained at its original value. The load is again increased and the test is repeated until the protective device operates or the motor stalls.During the test, the winding temperature shall not exceed140 \u00b0C, for class 105 (A) winding insulation;155 \u00b0C, for class 120 (E) winding insulation;165 \u00b0C, for class 130 (B) winding insulation;180 \u00b0C, for class 155 (F) winding insulation;200 \u00b0C, for class 180 (H) winding insulation;220 \u00b0C, for class 200 (N) winding insulation;240 \u00b0C, for class 220 (R) winding insulation;270 \u00b0C, for class 250 winding insulation.NOTE If the load cannot be increased in appropriate steps, the motor may be removed from the appliance and tested separately.Appliances incorporating series motors are operated with the lowest possible load and supplied at 1,3 times rated voltage for 1 min.During the test, parts shall not be ejected from the appliance.Electronic circuits are checked by evaluation of the fault conditions specified in19.11.2 for all circuits or parts of circuits, unless they comply with the conditions specified in 19.11.1.NOTE 1 In general, examination of the appliance and its circuit diagram will reveal the fault conditions which have to be simulated, so that testing can be limited to those cases that may be expected to give the most unfavourable results.Appliances incorporating an electronic circuit that relies upon a programmable component to function correctly are subjected to the test of 19.11.4.8, unless restarting at any point in the operating cycle after interruption of operation due to a supply voltage dip will not result in a hazard. The test is carried out after removal of all batteries and other components intended to maintain the programmable component supply voltage during mains supply voltage dips, interruptions and variations.Appliances having a device with an off position obtained by electronic disconnection, or a device that can place the appliance in a stand-by mode, are subjected to the tests of 19.11.4.NOTE 2 For information on general guidance relating to the sequence of tests for the evaluation of electronic circuits, reference should be made to Annex Q. It should be realized that in the Parts 2 there may be additional or alternative abnormal operation tests specified; these are not shown in the flow chart. For correct application of the standard, the normative text takes precedence over the guidance given in Annex Q.If the safety of the appliance under any of the fault conditions depends on the operation of a miniature fuse-link complying with IEC 60127, the test of 19.12 is carried out.60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010 \u2013 51 \u2013During and after each test, the temperature of windings shall not exceed the values specified in Table 8. However, these limits do not apply to fail-safe transformers complying with Subclause 15.5 of IEC 61558-1. The appliance shall comply with the conditions specified in19.13. Any current  flowing through protective impedance shall not exceed the limits specified in 8.1.4.NOTE 3 Unless it is necessary to replace components after any of the tests, the electric strength test required by19.13 need only be carried out after the final test on the electronic circuit.If a conductor of a printed circuit board becomes open-circuited, the appliance is considered to have withstood the particular test, provided both of the following conditions are met:the base material of the printed circuit board withstands the test of Annex E;any loosened conductor does not reduce clearances or creepage distances between live parts and accessible metal parts below the values specified in Clause 29.Fault conditions a) to g) specified in 19.11.2 are not applied to circuits or parts of circuits when both of the following conditions are met:the electronic circuit is a low-power circuit as described below;protection against electric shock, fire hazard, mechanical hazard or dangerous malfunction of other parts of the appliance does not rely on the correct functioning of the electronic circuit.An example of a low-power circuit is shown in Figure 6 and is determined as follows.The appliance is supplied at rated voltage and a variable resistor, adjusted to its maximum resistance, is connected between the point to be investigated and the opposite pole of the supply source. The resistance is then decreased until the power consumed by the resistor reaches a maximum. Points closest to the supply source at which the maximum power delivered to this resistor does not exceed 15 W at the end of 5 s are called low-power points. The part of the circuit farther from the supply source than a low-power point is considered to be a low-power circuit.NOTE 1 The measurements should be made from only one pole of the supply source, preferably the one that gives the fewest low-power points.NOTE 2 When determining the low-power points, it is recommended to start with points close to the supply source.NOTE 3 The power consumed by the variable resistor should be measured by a wattmeter.The following fault conditions are considered and, if necessary, applied one at a time, consequential faults being taken into consideration:short circuit of functional insulation if clearances or creepage distances are less than the values specified in Clause 29;open circuit at the terminals of any component;short circuit of capacitors, unless they comply with IEC 60384-14;short circuit of any two terminals of an electronic component, other than an integrated circuit. This fault condition is not applied between the two circuits of an optocoupler;failure of triacs in the diode mode;failure of microprocessors and integrated circuits except components such as thyristors and triacs. All possible output signals are considered for faults occurring within the component. If it can be shown that a particular output signal is unlikely to occur, then the relevant fault is not considered.failure of an electronic power switching device in a partial turn-on mode with loss of gate (base) control.\u2013 52 \u2013 60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010NOTE 1 This mode may be simulated by disconnecting the electronic power switching device gate (base) terminal and connecting an external adjustable power supply between the gate (base) terminal and the source (emitter) terminal of the electronic power switching device. The power supply is then varied so as to achieve a current that will not damage the electronic power switching device but will give the most onerous conditions of test.NOTE 2 Examples of electronic power switching devices are field effect transistors (FET\u2019s and MOSFET\u2019s) and bipolar transistors (including IGBT\u2019s).Fault condition f) is applied to encapsulated and similar components if the circuit cannot be assessed by other methods.Positive temperature coefficient resistors are not short-circuited if they are used within the manufacturer's specification. However, PTC-S thermistors are short-circuited unless they comply with IEC 60738-1.In addition, each low-power circuit is short-circuited by connecting the low-power point to the pole of the supply source from which the measurements were made.For simulation of the fault conditions, the appliance is operated under the conditions specified in Clause 11 but supplied at rated voltage.When any of the fault conditions are simulated, the duration of the test isas specified in 11.7 but only for one operating cycle and only if the fault cannot be recognized by the user, for example, a change in temperature;as specified in 19.7, if the fault can be recognized by the user, for example, when the motor of a kitchen machine stops;until steady conditions are established, for circuits continuously connected to the supply mains, for example, stand-by circuits.In each case, the test is ended if a non-self-resetting interruption of the supply occurs within the appliance.If the appliance incorporates a protective electronic circuit which operates to ensure compliance with Clause 19, the relevant test is repeated with a single fault simulated, as indicated in a) to g) of 19.11.2.NOTE The compliance criteria applied for these tests are those detailed in 19.13.Appliances having a device with an off position obtained by electronic disconnection, or a device that can be placed in the stand-by mode, are subjected to the tests of 19.11.4.1 to 19.11.4.7. The tests are carried out with the appliance supplied at rated voltage, the device being set in the off position or in the stand-by mode.Appliances incorporating a protective electronic circuit are subjected to the tests ofto 19.11.4.7. The tests are carried out after the protective electronic circuit has operated during the relevant tests of Clause 19 except 19.2, 19.6 and 19.11.3. However, appliances that are operated for 30 s or 5 min during the test of 19.7 are not subjected to the tests for electromagnetic phenomena.The tests are carried  out with surge  protective devices disconnected,  unless they incorporate spark gaps.NOTE 1 If the appliance has several modes of operation, the tests are carried out with the appliance operating in each mode, if necessary.NOTE 2 Appliances incorporating electronic controls complying with the IEC 60730 series of standards are not exempt from the tests.60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010 \u2013 53 \u2013The appliance is subjected to electrostatic discharges in accordance with IEC 61000-4-2, test level 4 being applicable. Ten discharges having a positive polarity and ten discharges having a negative polarity are applied at each preselected point.The appliance is subjected to radiated fields in accordance with IEC 61000-4-3, test level 3 being applicable.The frequency ranges tested shall be 80 MHz to 1 000 MHz and 1,4 GHz to 2,0 GHz.NOTE The dwell time for each frequency is to be sufficient to observe a possible malfunction of the protectiveelectronic circuit.The appliance is subjected to fast transient bursts in accordance with IEC 61000-4-4. Test level 3 with a repetition rate of 5 kHz is applicable for signal and control lines. Test level 4 with a repetition rate of 5 kHz is applicable for the power supply lines. The bursts are applied for 2 min with a positive polarity and for 2 min with a negative polarity.The power supply terminals of the appliance are subjected to voltage surges in accordance with IEC 61000-4-5, five positive impulses and five negative impulses being applied at the selected points. Test level 3 is applicable for the line-to-line coupling mode, a generator having a source impedance of 2 \u03a9 being used. Test level 4 is applicable for the line-to-earth coupling mode, a generator having a source impedance of 12 \u03a9 being used.Earthed heating elements in class I appliances are disconnected during this test.NOTE If a feedback system depends on inputs related to a disconnected heating element, an artificial network may be needed.For appliances having surge arresters incorporating spark gaps, the test is repeated at a level that is 95 % of the flashover voltage.The appliance is subjected to injected currents in accordance with IEC 61000-4-6, test level 3 being applicable. During the test, all frequencies between 0,15 MHz to 80 MHz are covered.NOTE The dwell time for each frequency is to be sufficient to observe a possible malfunction of the protective electronic circuit.For appliances having a rated current not exceeding 16 A, the appliance is subjected to the class 3 voltage dips and interruptions in accordance with IEC 61000-4-11. The values specified in Table 1 and Table 2 of IEC 61000-4-11 are applied at zero crossing of the supply voltage.For appliances having a rated current exceeding 16 A, the appliance is subjected to the class 3 voltage dips and interruptions in accordance with IEC 61000-4-34. The values specified in Table 1 and Table 2 of IEC 61000-4-34 are applied at zero crossing of the supply voltage.The appliance is subjected to mains signals in accordance with IEC 61000-4-13, Table 11 with test level class 2 using the frequency steps according to Table 10.The appliance is supplied at rated voltage and operated under normal operation. After approximately 60 s, the power supply voltage is reduced to a level such that the appliance ceases to respond to user inputs or parts controlled by the programmable component cease to operate, whichever occurs first. This value of supply voltage is recorded. The appliance is supplied at rated voltage and operated under normal operation. The voltage is then reduced to a value of approximately 10 % less than the recorded voltage. It is held at this value for approximately 60 s and then increased to rated voltage. The rate of decrease and increase of the power supply voltage is to be approximately 10 V/s.\u2013 54 \u2013 60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010The appliance shall continue to either operate normally from the same point in its operating cycle at which the voltage decrease occurred or a manual operation shall be required to restart it.If safety of the appliance depends upon the operation of a miniature fuse-link complying with IEC 60127 during any of the fault conditions specified in 19.11.2, the test is repeated but with the miniature fuse-link replaced by an ammeter. If the current measureddoes not exceed 2,1 times the rated current of the fuse-link, the circuit is not considered to be adequately protected and the test is carried out with the fuse-link short-circuited;is at least 2,75 times the rated current of the fuse-link, the circuit is considered to be adequately protected;is between 2,1 times and 2,75 times the rated current of the fuse-link, the fuse link is short-circuited and the test is carried outfor the relevant period or for 30 min, whichever is the shorter, for quick acting fuse- links;for the relevant period or for 2 min, whichever is the shorter, for time lag fuse-links.NOTE 1 In case of doubt, the maximum resistance of the fuse-link has to be taken into account when determining the current.NOTE 2 The verification whether the fuse-link acts as a protective device is based on the fusing characteristics specified in IEC 60127, which also gives the information necessary to calculate the maximum resistance of the fuse-link.NOTE 3 Other fuses are considered to be intentionally weak parts in accordance with 19.1.During the tests, the appliance shall not emit flames, molten metal, or poisonous or ignitable gas in hazardous amounts and temperature rises shall not exceed the values shown in Table 9.After the tests, and when the appliance has cooled to approximately room temperature, compliance with Clause 8 shall not be impaired and the appliance shall comply with 20.2 if it can still be operated.Table 9 \u2013 Maximum abnormal temperature  risePartTemperature riseKWooden supports, walls, ceiling and floor of the test corner and wooden cabinets a150Insulation of the supply cord a without T marking, or with T marking up to 75 \u00b0C150Insulation of the supply cord a with T marking above 75 \u00b0CT+75Supplementary insulation and reinforced insulation other than thermoplastic materials b1,5 times the relevant value specified in Table 3a bFor motor-operated appliances, these temperature rises are not determined.There is no specific limit for supplementary insulation and reinforced insulation of thermoplastic material. However, the temperature rise has to be determined so that the test of 30.1 can be carried out.When the insulation, other than that of class III appliances or class III constructions that do not contain live parts, has cooled down to approximately room temperature, it shall withstand the electric strength test of 16.3, the test voltage, however, being as specified in Table 4.The humidity treatment of 15.3 is not applied before this electric strength test.60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010 \u2013 55 \u2013For appliances which are immersed in or filled with conducting liquid in normal use, the appliance is immersed in or filled with water for 24 h before the electric strength test is carried out.After the operation or interruption of a control, clearances and creepage distances across the functional insulation shall withstand the electric strength test of 16.3, the test voltage, however, being twice the working voltage.The appliance shall not undergo a dangerous malfunction, and there shall be no failure ofprotective electronic circuits if the appliance is still operable.Appliances tested with an electronic switch in the off position, or in the stand-by mode, shallnot become operational, orif they become operational, not result in a dangerous malfunction during or after the tests of 19.11.4.NOTE Unintended operation that may impair safety, can result from careless use of appliances, such as:storage of small appliances while connected to the supply;placing flammable material on working surfaces of heating appliances; orplacing objects in areas near motorized appliances that are not expected to start.In an appliance containing lids or doors that are controlled by one or more interlocks, one of the interlocks may be released provided that both of the following conditions are fulfilled:the lid or door does not move automatically to an open position when the interlock is released;the appliance will not restart after the cycle in which the interlock was released.Appliances are operated under the conditions of Clause 11. Any contactor or relay contact that operates under the conditions of Clause 11 is short-circuited.If a relay or contactor with more than one contact is used, all contacts are short-circuited at the same time.Any relay or contactor which operates only in order to ensure that the appliance is energized for normal use and that does not otherwise operate in normal use is not short-circuited.If more than one relay or contactor operates in Clause 11, each such relay or contactor is short-circuited in turn.NOTE If the appliance has several modes of operation, the tests are carried out with the appliance operating in each mode, if necessary.For appliances incorporating a mains voltage selector switch, this switch is set to the lowest rated voltage position and the highest value of rated voltage is applied.", "Appliances, other than fixed appliances and hand-held appliances, intended to be used on a surface such as the floor or a table, shall have adequate stability.Compliance is checked by the following test, appliances incorporating an appliance inlet being fitted with an appropriate connector and flexible cord.\u2013 56 \u2013 60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010The appliance, not connected to the supply mains, is placed in any normal position of use on a plane inclined at an angle of 10\u00b0 to the horizontal, the supply cord resting on the inclined plane in the most unfavourable position. However, if part of an appliance comes into contact with the horizontal supporting surface when the appliance is tilted through an angle of 10\u00b0, the appliance is placed on a horizontal support and tilted in the most unfavourable direction through an angle of 10\u00b0.NOTE The test on the horizontal support may be necessary for appliances provided with rollers, castors or feet. In this case, castors or wheels may be blocked to prevent the appliance from rolling.Appliances provided with doors are tested with the doors open or closed, whichever is the more unfavourable.Appliances intended to be filled with liquid by the user in normal use are tested empty or filled with the most unfavourable quantity of water up to the capacity indicated in the instructions.The appliance shall not overturn.The test is repeated on appliances with heating elements with the angle of inclination increased to 15\u00b0. If the appliance overturns in one or more positions, it is subjected to the tests of Clause 11 in each of these overturned positions.During this test, temperature rises shall not exceed the values shown in Table 9.Moving parts of appliances shall, as far as is compatible with the use and working of the appliance, be positioned or enclosed to provide adequate protection against personal injury in normal use. This requirement does not apply to parts of an appliance that necessarily have to be exposed to allow the appliance to perform its working function.NOTE 1 Examples of parts of appliances necessarily exposed to perform the working function include the needle of a sewing machine, rotating brushes of vacuum cleaner and the blade of an electrical knife.Protective enclosures, guards and similar parts shall be non-detachable parts and shall have adequate mechanical strength. However, enclosures that can be opened by overriding an interlock by applying the test probe are considered to be detachable parts.The unexpected closure of self-resetting thermal cut-outs and overcurrent protective devices shall not cause a hazard.NOTE 2 An example of an appliance in which self-resetting thermal cut-outs and overcurrent protective devices could cause a hazard is a food mixer.Compliance is checked by inspection, by the test of 21.1 and by applying a force not exceeding 5 N by means of a test probe that is similar to test probe B of IEC 61032 but having a circular stop face with a diameter of 50 mm, instead of the non-circular face.For appliances provided with movable devices such as those intended for varying the tension of belts, the test with the test probe is carried out with these devices adjusted to the most unfavourable position within their range of adjustment. If necessary, belts are removed.It shall not be possible to touch dangerous moving parts with this test probe.", "Appliances shall have adequate mechanical strength and be constructed to withstand such rough handling that may be expected in normal use.60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010 \u2013 57 \u2013Compliance is checked by applying blows to the appliance in accordance with test Ehb of IEC 60068-2-75, the spring hammer test.The appliance is rigidly supported and three blows, having an impact energy of 0,5 J, are applied to every point of the enclosure that is likely to be weak.If necessary, the blows are also applied to handles, levers, knobs and similar parts and to signal lamps and their covers but only if the lamps or covers protrude from the enclosure by more than 10 mm or if their surface area exceeds 4 cm2. Lamps within the appliance and their covers are only tested if they are likely to be damaged in normal use.NOTE When applying the release cone to the guard of a visibly glowing heating element, care is to be taken that the hammer head passing through the guard does not strike the heating element.After the test, the appliance shall show no damage that could impair compliance with this standard and compliance with 8.1, 15.1 and Clause 29 shall not be impaired. In case of doubt, supplementary insulation and reinforced insulation are subjected to the electric strength test of 16.3.Damage to the finish, small dents that do not reduce clearances or creepage distances below the values specified in Clause 29, and small chips that do not adversely affect protection against access to live parts or moisture, are ignored.If a decorative cover is protected by an inner cover, fracture of the decorative cover is ignored if the inner cover itself withstands the test.If there is doubt as to whether a defect has occurred by the application of the preceding blows or the previous tests, this defect is neglected and the group of three blows is applied to the same place on a new sample which shall then withstand the test.Cracks not visible to the naked eye and surface cracks in fibre-reinforced mouldings and similar materials are ignored.Accessible parts  of solid insulation shall  have sufficient strength to prevent penetration by sharp implements.Compliance is checked by subjecting the insulation to the following test, unless the thickness of supplementary insulation is at least 1 mm and that of reinforced insulation is at least 2 mm.The insulation is raised to the temperature measured during the test of Clause 11. The surface of the insulation is then scratched by means of a hardened steel pin, the end of which has the form of a cone with an angle of 40\u00b0. Its tip is rounded with a radius of 0,25 mm \u00b1 0,02 mm. The pin is held at any angle from 80\u00b0 to 85\u00b0 to the horizontal and loaded so that the force exerted along its axis is 10 N \u00b1 0,5 N. The scratches are made by drawing the pin along the surface of the insulation at a speed of approximately 20 mm/s. Two parallel scratches are made. They are spaced sufficiently apart so that they are not affected by each other, their length covering approximately 25 % of the length of the insulation. Two similar scratches are made at 90\u00b0 to the first pair without crossing them.The test fingernail of Figure 7 is then applied to the scratched surface with a force of approximately 10 N. No further damage, such as separation of the material, shall occur. The insulation shall then withstand the electric strength test of 16.3.The hardened steel pin is then applied perpendicularly with a force of 30 N \u00b1 0,5 N to an unscratched part of the surface. The insulation shall then withstand the electric strength test of 16.3 with the pin still applied and used as one of the electrodes.\u2013 58 \u2013 60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010", "s of cord anchorages 111Figure 10 \u2013 An example of parts of an earthing terminal 112Figure 11 \u2013 Examples of clearances 113Figure 12 \u2013 Example of the placement of the cylinder 114Figure I.1 \u2013 Simulation of faults 129Figure L.1 \u2013 Sequence for the determination of clearances 133Figure L.2 \u2013 Sequence for the determination of creepage distances 135Figure O.1 \u2013 Tests for resistance to heat 138Figure O.2 \u2013 Selection and sequence of tests for resistance to fire in hand-heldappliances 139Figure O.3 \u2013 Selection and sequence of tests for resistance to fire in attendedappliances 140Figure O.4 \u2013 Selection and sequence of tests for resistance to fire in unattendedappliances 141Figure O.5 \u2013 Some applications of the term \"within a distance of 3 mm\" 143\u2013 4 \u2013 60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010Table 1 \u2013 Power input deviation 33Table 2 \u2013 Current deviation 34Table 3 \u2013 Maximum normal temperature rises 37Table 4 \u2013 Voltage for electric strength test 41Table 5 \u2013 Characteristics of high-voltage sources 42Table 6 \u2013 Impulse test voltage 42Table 7 \u2013 Test voltages 46Table 8 \u2013 Maximum winding temperature 49Table 9 \u2013 Maximum abnormal temperature rise 54Table 10 \u2013 Dimensions of cables and conduits 75Table 11 \u2013 Minimum cross-sectional area of conductors 77Table 12 \u2013 Pull force and torque 79Table 13 \u2013 Nominal cross-sectional area of conductors 83Table 14 \u2013 Torque for testing screws and nuts 87Table 15 \u2013 Rated impulse voltage 89Table 16 \u2013 Minimum clearances 90Table 17 \u2013 Minimum creepage distances for basic insulation 94Table 18 \u2013 Minimum creepage distances for functional insulation 95Table 19 \u2013 Minimum thickness for accessible parts of reinforced insulation consistingof a single layer 96Table A.1 \u2013 Test voltages 116Table C.1 \u2013 Test conditions 120Table R.1 e \u2013 General fault/error conditions 150Table R.2 e \u2013 Specific fault/error conditions 153Table R.3 \u2013 Semi-formal methods 159Table R.4 \u2013 Software architecture specification 159Table R.5 \u2013 Module design specification 160Table R.6 \u2013 Design and coding standards 160Table R.7 \u2013 Software safety validation 16160335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010 \u2013 5 \u2013INTERNATIONAL ELECTROTECHNICAL COMMISSIONHOUSEHOLD AND SIMILAR ELECTRICAL APPLIANCES \u2013 SAFETY  \u2013Part 1: General requirementsFOREWORDThe International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) is a worldwide organization for standardization comprising all national electrotechnical committees (IEC National Committees). The object of IEC is to promote international co-operation on all questions concerning standardization in the electrical and electronic fields. To this end and in addition to other activities, IEC publishes International Standards, Technical Specifications, Technical Reports, Publicly Available Specifications (PAS) and Guides (hereafter referred to as \u201cIEC Publication(s)\u201d). Their preparation is entrusted to technical committees; any IEC National Committee interested in the subject dealt with may participate in this preparatory work.

At this date, the publication will bereconfirmed,withdrawn,replaced by a revised edition, oramended.NOTE 3 The attention of National Committees is drawn to the fact that equipment manufacturers and testing organizations may need a transitional period following publication of a new, amended or revised IEC publication in which to make products in accordance with the new requirements and to equip themselves for conducting new or revised tests.It is the recommendation of the committee that the content of this publication be adopted for implementation nationally not earlier than 12 months or later than 36 months from the date of publication.60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010 \u2013 7 \u2013The following differences exist in the countries indicated below.Introduction: The Part 1 standard (UL60335-1) is only used in combination with a part 2 (UL60335-2-x).National differences are specified in these standards (USA).5.7: The ambient temperature is 25 \u00b0C \u00b1 10 \u00b0C (Japan).5.7: The ambient temperature is 27 \u00b0C \u00b1 5 \u00b0C (India).6.1: Class 0 appliances and class 0I appliances are not allowed (Australia, Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, India, Israel, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Singapore, Slovakia, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom).7.12.2: The requirements for full disconnection do not apply (Japan).13.2: The test circuit and some leakage current limits are different (India).22.2: The second paragraph of this subclause dealing with single-phase class I appliances with heating elements cannot be complied with because of the supply system (France and Norway).22.2: Double-pole switches or protective devices are required (Norway).22.35 Accessible metal parts separated from live parts by earthed metal parts are not regarded as likely to become live in the event of an insulation fault (USA).24.1: IEC component standard requirements are replaced by the relevant requirements of component standards specified in UL60335-1 and parts 2 (UL60335-2-x) (USA).25.3: A set of supply leads is not permitted (Norway, Denmark, Finland, Netherlands).25.8: 0,5 mm2 supply cords are not allowed for class I appliances (Australia and New Zealand).26.6: Conductor cross-sectional areas are different (USA).29.1: Different rated impulse voltages are used between 50 V and 150 V (Japan).\u2013 8 \u2013 60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010INTRODUCTIONIt has been assumed in the drafting of this International Standard that the execution of its provisions is entrusted to appropriately qualified and experienced persons.This standard recognizes the internationally accepted level of protection against hazards such as electrical, mechanical, thermal, fire and radiation of appliances when operated as in normal use taking into account the manufacturer's instructions. It also covers abnormal situations that  can  be expected  in practice  and takes  into account  the way in which electromagnetic phenomena can affect the safe operation of appliances.This standard takes into account the requirements of IEC 60364 as far as possible so that there is compatibility with the wiring rules when the appliance is connected to the supply mains. However, national wiring rules may differ.If the functions of an appliance are covered by different parts 2 of IEC 60335, the relevant part 2 is applied to each function separately, as far as is reasonable. If applicable, the influence of one function on the other is taken into account.NOTE 1 Throughout this publication, when \u201cPart 2\u201d is mentioned, it refers to the relevant part of IEC 60335.When a part 2 standard does not include additional requirements to cover hazards dealt with in Part 1, Part 1 applies.NOTE 2 This means that the technical committees responsible for the part 2 standards have determined that it is not necessary to specify particular requirements for the appliance in question over and above the general requirements.This standard is a product family standard dealing with the safety of appliances and takes precedence over horizontal and generic standards covering the same subject.NOTE 3 Horizontal and generic standards covering a hazard are not applicable since they have been taken into consideration when developing the general and particular requirements for the IEC 60335 series of standards. For example, in the case of temperature requirements for surfaces on many appliances, generic standards, such as ISO 13732-1 for hot surfaces, are not applicable in addition to Part 1 or part 2 standards.Individual countries may wish to consider the application of the standard, as far as is reasonable, to appliances not mentioned in a part 2, and to appliances designed on new principles.An appliance that complies with the text of this standard will not necessarily be considered to comply with the safety principles of the standard if, when examined and tested, it is found to have other features which impair the level of safety covered by these requirements.An appliance employing materials or having forms of construction differing from those detailed in the requirements of this standard may be examined and tested according to the intent of the requirements and, if found to be substantially equivalent, may be considered to comply with the standard.NOTE 4 Standards dealing with non-safety aspects of household appliances areIEC standards published by TC 59 concerning methods of measuring performance;CISPR 11, CISPR 14-1, IEC 61000-3-2 and IEC 61000-3-3 concerning electromagnetic emissions;CISPR 14-2 concerning electromagnetic immunity;IEC standards published by TC 111 concerning environmental matters.60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010 \u2013 9 \u2013HOUSEHOLD AND SIMILAR ELECTRICAL APPLIANCES \u2013 SAFETY  \u2013Part 1: General requirementsScopeThis International Standard deals with the safety of electrical appliances for household and similar purposes, their rated voltage being not more than 250 V for single-phase appliances and 480 V for other appliances.NOTE 1 Battery-operated appliances and other d.c. supplied appliances are within the scope of this standard.Appliances not intended for normal household use but which nevertheless may be a source of danger to the public, such as appliances intended to be used by laymen in shops, in light industry and on farms, are within the scope of this standard.NOTE 2 Examples of such appliances are catering equipment, cleaning appliances for commercial use, and appliances for hairdressers.As far as is practicable, this standard  deals  with the  common hazards  presented by appliances that are encountered by all persons in and around the home. However, in general, it does not take into accountpersons (including children) whosephysical, sensory or mental capabilities; orlack of experience and knowledgeprevents them from using the appliance safely without supervision or instruction;children playing with the appliance.NOTE 3 Attention is drawn to the fact thatfor appliances intended to be used in vehicles or on board ships or aircraft, additional requirements may be necessary;in many countries, additional requirements are specified by the national health authorities, the national authorities responsible for the protection of labour, the national water supply authorities and similar authorities.NOTE 4 This standard does not apply toappliances intended exclusively for industrial purposes;appliances intended to be used in locations where special conditions prevail, such as the presence of a corrosive or explosive atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas);audio, video and similar electronic apparatus (IEC 60065);appliances for medical purposes (IEC 60601);hand-held motor-operated electric tools (IEC 60745);personal computers and similar equipment (IEC 60950-1);transportable motor-operated electric tools (IEC 61029).Normative referencesThe following referenced documents are indispensable for the application of this document.

However, the tests of Clauses 20, 22 (except 22.10, 22.11 and 22.18) to 26, 28, 30 and 31 may be carried out on separate appliances. The test of 22.3 is carried out on a new appliance.NOTE 1 Additional samples may be required if the appliance has to be tested under different conditions, for example if it can be supplied with different voltages.If an intentionally weak part becomes open circuit during the tests of Clause 19, an additional appliance may be needed.The testing of components may require the submission of additional samples of these components. If the test of Annex C has to be carried out, six samples of the motor are needed.If the test of Annex D has to be carried out, an additional appliance may be used. If the tests of Annex G are carried out, four additional transformers are needed.If the tests of Annex H are carried out, three switches or three additional appliances are needed.NOTE 2 The cumulative stress resulting from successive tests on electronic circuits is to be avoided. It may be necessary to replace components or to use additional samples. The number of additional samples should be kept to a minimum by an evaluation of the relevant electronic circuits.NOTE 3 If an appliance has to be dismantled in order to carry out a test, care is to be taken to ensure that it is reassembled as originally supplied. In case of doubt, subsequent tests may be carried out on a separate sample.The tests are carried out in the order of the clauses. However, the test of 22.11 on the appliance at room temperature is carried out before the tests of Clause 8. The tests of Clause 14 and 21.2 and 22.24 are carried out after the tests of Clause 29. The test of 19.14 is carried out before the tests of 19.11.If it is evident from the construction of the appliance that a particular test is not applicable, the test is not carried out.When testing appliances that are also supplied by other energies such as gas, the influence of their consumption has to be taken into account.The tests are carried out with the appliance or any movable part of it placed in the most unfavourable position that may occur in normal use.Appliances provided with controls or switching devices are tested with these controls or devices adjusted to their most unfavourable setting, if the setting can be altered by the user.NOTE 1 If the adjusting means of the control is accessible without the aid of a tool, this subclause applies whether the setting can be altered by hand or with the aid of a tool. If the adjusting means is not accessible without the aid of a tool and if the setting is not intended to be altered by the user, this subclause does not apply.NOTE 2 Adequate sealing is regarded as preventing alteration of the setting by the user.\u2013 22 \u2013 60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010For appliances fitted with a voltage selector switch, unless otherwise specified, the tests are carried out with the switch in the position corresponding to the rated voltage value used for the tests.The tests are carried out in a draught-free location at an ambient temperature of 20 \u00b0C \u00b1 5 \u00b0C.If the temperature attained by any part is limited by a temperature sensitive device or is influenced by the temperature at which a change of state occurs, for example when water boils, the ambient temperature is maintained at 23 \u00b0C \u00b1 2 \u00b0C in case of doubt.Test conditions relating to frequency and voltageAppliances for a.c. only are tested with a.c. at rated frequency, and those for a.c. andd.c. are tested at the more unfavourable supply.Appliances for a.c. that are not marked with rated frequency or are marked with a rated frequency range of 50 Hz to 60 Hz are tested with either 50 Hz or 60 Hz, whichever is the more unfavourable.Appliances having more than one rated voltage are tested on the basis of the most unfavourable voltage.For motor-operated appliances, and combined appliances, marked with a rated voltage range, when it is specified that the supply voltage is equal to the rated voltage multiplied by a factor, the appliance is supplied atthe upper limit of the rated voltage range multiplied by this factor, if greater than 1;the lower limit of the rated voltage range multiplied by this factor, if smaller than 1.When a factor is not specified, the supply voltage is the most unfavourable within the rated voltage range.NOTE 1 If a heating appliance has a rated voltage range, the upper limit of the voltage range will usually be the most unfavourable voltage within the range.NOTE 2 For motor-operated appliances, combined appliances and appliances having more than one rated voltage or rated voltage range, it may be necessary to make some of the tests at the minimum, the mean and the maximum values of the rated voltage or the rated voltage range in order to establish the most unfavourable voltage.For heating appliances, and combined appliances, marked with a rated power input range, when it is specified that the power input is equal to the rated power input multiplied by a factor, the appliance is operated atthe upper limit of the rated power input range multiplied by this factor, if greater than 1;the lower limit of the rated power input range multiplied by this factor, if smaller than 1.When a factor is not specified, the power input is the most unfavourable within the rated power input range.For appliances  marked with  a rated voltage  range  and rated  power input corresponding to the mean of the rated voltage range, when it is specified that the power input is equal to rated power input multiplied by a factor, the appliance is operated atthe calculated power input corresponding to the upper limit of the rated voltage rangemultiplied by this factor, if greater than 1;60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010 \u2013 23 \u2013the calculated power input corresponding to the lower limit of the rated voltage rangemultiplied by this factor, if smaller than 1.When a factor is not specified, the power input corresponds to the power input at the most unfavourable voltage within the rated voltage range.When alternative heating elements or accessories are made available by the appliance manufacturer, the appliance is tested with those elements or accessories which give the most unfavourable results.The tests are carried out on the  appliance as supplied. However,  an appliance constructed as a single appliance but supplied in a number of units is tested after assembly in accordance with the instructions provided with the appliance.Built-in appliances and fixed appliances are installed in accordance with the instructions provided with the appliance before testing.Appliances intended to be connected to fixed wiring by means of a flexible cord are tested with the appropriate flexible cord connected to the appliance.For heating appliances and combined appliances, when it is specified that the appliance has to operate at a power input multiplied by a factor, this applies only to heating elements without appreciable positive temperature coefficient of resistance.For heating elements with appreciable positive temperature coefficient of resistance, other than PTC heating elements, the supply voltage is determined by supplying the appliance at rated voltage until the heating element reaches its operating temperature. The supply voltage is then rapidly increased to the value necessary to give the power input required for the relevant test, this value of the supply voltage being maintained throughout the test.NOTE In general, the temperature coefficient is considered to be appreciable if, at rated voltage, the power input of the appliance in cold condition differs by more than 25 % from the power input at operating temperature.The tests for appliances with PTC heating elements and for heating appliances and combined appliances where the heating elements are supplied via a switch mode power supply are carried out at a voltage corresponding to the specified power input.When a power input greater than the rated power input is specified, the factor for multiplying the voltage is equal to the square root of the factor for multiplying the power input.If class 0I appliances or class I appliances have accessible metal parts that are not earthed and are not separated from live parts by an intermediate metal part that is earthed, such parts are checked for compliance with the appropriate requirements specified for class II construction.If class 0I appliances or class I appliances have accessible non-metallic parts, such parts are checked for compliance with the appropriate requirements specified for class II construction unless these parts are separated from live parts by an intermediate metal part that is earthed.NOTE Guidance is given in Annex P for enhanced requirements that may be used to ensure an acceptable level of protection against electrical and thermal hazards for particular types of appliances used in an installation without a protective earthing conductor in countries that have warm damp equable climates.If appliances have parts operating at safety extra-low voltage, such parts are checked for compliance with the appropriate requirements specified for class III construction.\u2013 24 \u2013 60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010When testing electronic circuits, the supply is to be free from perturbations from external sources that can influence the results of the tests.Appliances powered by rechargeable batteries are tested in accordance with Annex B.If linear and angular dimensions are specified without a tolerance, ISO 2768-1 is applicable.If a component or part of the appliance has both a self resetting feature and a non- self-resetting feature and if the non-self-resetting feature is not required in order to comply with the standard, then appliances incorporating such a component or part shall be tested with the non-self-resetting feature rendered inoperative.ClassificationAppliances shall be of one of the following classes with respect to protection against electric shock:class 0, class 0I, class I, class II, class III.Compliance is checked by inspection and by the relevant tests.Appliances shall have the appropriate degree of protection against harmful ingress of water.Compliance is checked by inspection and by the relevant tests.NOTE The degrees of protection against harmful ingress of water are given in IEC 60529.Marking and instructionsAppliances shall be marked with therated voltage or rated voltage range in volts;symbol for nature of supply, unless the rated frequency is marked;rated power input in watts or rated current in amperes;name, trade mark or identification mark of the manufacturer or responsible vendor;model or type reference;symbol IEC 60417-5172 (2003-02) for class II appliances only;IP number according to degree of protection against ingress of water, other than IPX0;symbol IEC 60417-5180 (2003-02), for class  III appliances. This marking  is not necessary for appliances that are operated only by batteries  (primary batteries  or secondary batteries that are recharged outside of the appliance).NOTE 1 The first numeral of the IP number need not be marked on the appliance.NOTE 2 Additional markings are allowed provided they do not give rise to misunderstanding.NOTE 3 If components are marked separately, the marking of the appliance and that of the components is to be such that there can be no doubt with regard to the marking of the appliance itself.NOTE 4 If the appliance is marked with rated pressure, the units used may be bars but only together with pascals and placed in brackets.60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010 \u2013 25 \u2013The enclosure of electrically-operated water valves incorporated in external hose-sets for connection of an appliance to the water mains shall be marked with symbol IEC 60417-5036 (2002-10) if their working voltage exceeds extra-low voltage.Compliance is checked by inspection.Stationary appliances for multiple supply shall be marked with the substance of the following:Warning: Before obtaining access to terminals, all supply circuits must be disconnected.This warning shall be placed in the vicinity of the terminal cover.Compliance is checked by inspection.Appliances having  a range  of rated  values  and which can be operated without adjustment throughout the range shall be marked with the lower and upper limits of the range separated by a hyphen.NOTE 1 Example: 115-230 V: The appliance is suitable for any value within the marked range (a curling iron with a PTC heating element or an appliance incorporating an input switch mode power supply).Appliances having different rated values and which have to be adjusted for use at a particular value by the user or installer shall be marked with the different values separated by an oblique stroke.NOTE 2 Example: 115/230 V: The appliance is only suitable for the marked values (a shaver with a selector switch).NOTE 3 This requirement is also applicable to appliances with provision for connection to both single-phase and multi-phase supplies.Example: 230 V/400 V: The appliance is only suitable for the voltage values indicated, 230 V being for single- phase operation and 400 V for three-phase operation (a dishwasher with terminals for both supplies).Compliance is checked by inspection.If the appliance can be adjusted for different rated voltages, the voltage to which the appliance is adjusted shall be clearly discernible. If frequent changes in voltage setting are not required, this requirement is considered to  be met if the rated voltage to which the appliance is to be adjusted can be determined from a wiring diagram fixed to the appliance.NOTE The wiring diagram may be on the inside of a cover that has to be removed to connect the supply conductors. It is not to be on a label loosely attached to the appliance.Compliance is checked by inspection.For appliances marked with more than one rated voltage or with one or more rated voltage ranges, the rated power input or rated current for each of these voltages or ranges shall be marked. However, if the difference between the limits of a rated voltage range does not exceed 10 % of the arithmetic mean value of the range, the marking for rated power input or rated current may be related to the arithmetic mean value of the range.The upper and lower limits of the rated power input or rated current shall be marked on the appliance so that the relation between input and voltage is clear.Compliance is checked by inspection.When symbols are used, they shall be as follows\u2013 26 \u2013 60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010[symbol IEC 60417- 5031(2002-10)]direct current[symbol IEC 60417- 5032(2002-10)]alternating current3                [symbol IEC 60417- 5032-1(2002-10)]three-phase alternating current3N            [symbol IEC 60417- 5032-2(2002-10)]three-phase alternating current with neutral[symbol IEC 60417- 5016(2002-10)]fuse-linkNOTE 1 The rated current of the fuse link may be indicated in association with this symbol.time-lag miniature fuse-link  where X is the symbol  for the time/current characteristic as given in IEC 60127[symbol IEC 60417- 5019(2006-08)][symbol IEC 60417- 5018(2006-10)][symbol IEC 60417- 5172(2003-02)][symbol IEC 60417- 5012(2002-10)]protective earthfunctional earthingclass II equipmentlampNOTE 2 The rated wattage of the lamp may be indicated in association with this symbol.[symbol ISO 7000-0434(2004-01)]caution[symbol ISO 7000-0790(2004-01)]read operator's manual[symbol IEC 60417- 5021(2002-10)]equipotentiality[symbol IEC 60417-5036(2002-10)]dangerous voltage[symbol IEC 60417-5180(2003-02)]Class III applianceThe symbol for nature of supply shall be placed next to the marking for rated voltage.60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010 \u2013 27 \u2013The symbol for class II appliances shall be placed so that it will be obvious that it is a part of the technical information and is unlikely to be confused with any other marking.Units of physical quantities and their symbols shall be those of the international standardized system.NOTE 3 Additional symbols are allowed provided that they do not give rise to misunderstanding.

However, if the construction is such that the distances could be affected by wear, by distortion, by movement of the parts or during assembly, the clearances for rated impulse voltages of 1 500 V and above are increased by 0,5 mm and the impulse voltage test is not applicable.The impulse voltage test is not applicable when the microenvironment is pollution degree 3 or for basic insulation of class 0 appliances and class 0I appliances.NOTE 1 Examples of constructions for which the test may be applicable are those having rigid parts or parts located by mouldings.Examples of constructions in which distances are likely to be affected are those involving soldering, snap-on and screw terminals and clearances from motor windings.Appliances are in overvoltage category II.NOTE 2 Annex K gives information regarding overvoltage categories.Table 15 \u2013 Rated impulse  voltageRated voltageVRated impulse voltageVOvervoltage categoryIIIIII\u226450330500800>50 and \u22641508001 5002 500>150 and \u22643001 5002 5004 000NOTE 1 For multi-phase appliances, the line to neutral or line to earth voltage is used for rated voltage.NOTE 2 The  values  are  based on  the assumption that  the appliance will  not  generate higher overvoltages than  those specified. If higher overvoltages are generated, the clearances have to be increased accordingly.\u2013 90 \u2013 60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010Table 16 \u2013 Minimum clearancesRated impulse voltageVMinimum clearance amm3300,5 b, c, d5000,5 b, c, d8000,5 b, c, d1 500c0,52 5001,54 0003,06 0005,58 0008,010 00011,0a The distances specified apply only to clearances in air.b The smaller clearances specified in  IEC 60664-1  have  not been adopted for practical reasons, such as mass-production tolerances.c This value is increased to 0,8 mm for pollution degree 3.d For  tracks of  printed circuit boards  this  value is  reduced to 0,2 mm for pollution degree 1 and pollution degree 2.Compliance is checked by inspection and by measurement.Parts, such as hexagonal nuts that can be tightened to different positions during assembly, and movable parts are placed in the most unfavourable position.A force is applied to bare conductors, other than those of heating elements, and accessible surfaces to try to reduce clearances when making the measurement. The force is2 N, for bare conductors;30 N, for accessible surfaces.The force is applied by means of test probe B of IEC 61032. Apertures are assumed to be covered by a piece of flat metal.NOTE 3 The way in which clearances are measured is specified in IEC 60664-1. NOTE 4 The procedure for assessing clearances is given in Annex L.NOTE 5 For appliances intended for use at altitudes exceeding 2 000 m, the altitude correction factors forclearances specified in Table A.2 of IEC 60664-1 should be taken into account.The clearances of basic insulation shall be sufficient to withstand the overvoltages likely to occur during use, taking into account the rated impulse voltage. The values of Table 16, or the impulse voltage test of Clause 14, are applicable.NOTE The overvoltages may be derived from external sources or due to switching.The clearance at the terminals of tubular sheathed heating elements may be reduced to 1,0 mm if the microenvironment is pollution degree 1.Lacquered conductors of windings are considered to be bare conductors.Compliance is checked by measurement.60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010 \u2013 91 \u2013Clearances of supplementary insulation shall be not less than those specified forbasic insulation in Table 16.Compliance is checked by measurement.Clearances of reinforced insulation shall be not less than those specified for basic insulation in Table 16, using the next higher step for rated impulse voltage as a reference.Compliance is checked  by measurement.  For double  insulation, when there  is no intermediate conductive part between the basic insulation and supplementary insulation, clearances are measured between live parts and the accessible surface, and the insulation system is treated as reinforced insulation as shown in Figure 11.The clearances for functional insulation are the largest values determined fromTable 16 based on the rated impulse voltage;Table F.7a in IEC 60664-1 based on the steady-state voltage or recurring peak voltage expected to occur across it, if the frequency of the steady-state voltage or recurring peak voltage does not exceeds 30 kHz;Clause 4 of IEC 60664-4 based on the steady-state voltage or recurring peak  voltage expected to occur across it, if the frequency of the steady-state voltage or recurring peak voltage exceeds 30 kHz.If the values of Table 16 are largest, the impulse voltage test of Clause 14 may be applied instead unless the microenvironment is pollution degree 3 or the construction is such that the distances could be affected by wear, by distortion, by movement of the parts or during assembly.However, clearances are not specified if  the appliance complies with Clause 19 with thefunctional insulation short-circuited.Lacquered conductors of windings  are considered to be bare conductors. However,clearances at crossover points are not measured.The clearance between surfaces of PTC heating elements may be reduced to 1 mm.Compliance is checked by measurement and by a test if necessary.For appliances having higher working voltages than rated voltage, for example on the secondary side of a step-up transformer, or if there is a resonant voltage, the clearances for basic insulation are the largest values determined fromTable 16 based on the rated impulse voltage;Table F.7a in IEC 60664-1 based on the steady-state voltage or recurring peak voltage expected to occur across it, if the frequency of the steady-state voltage or recurring peak voltage does not exceed 30 kHz;Clause 4 of IEC 60664-4 based on the steady-state voltage or recurring peak voltage expected to occur across it, if the frequency of the steady-state voltage or recurring peak voltage exceeds 30 kHz.NOTE 1 Clearances for intermediate values of Table 16 may be determined by interpolation.If the clearances applied for basic insulation are selected from Table F.7a of IEC 60664-1 or Clause 4 of IEC 60664-4, then the clearances of supplementary insulation shall be not less than those specified for basic insulation.\u2013 92 \u2013 60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010If the clearances applied for basic insulation are selected from Table F.7a of IEC 60664-1, then the clearances of reinforced  insulation shall  be dimensioned as specified in Table F.7a to withstand 160 % of the withstand voltage required for basic insulation.If the clearances applied for basic insulation are selected from Clause 4 of IEC 60664-4, then the clearances of reinforced insulation shall be twice the value required for basic insulation.If the secondary winding of a step-down transformer is earthed, or if there is an earthed screen between the primary and secondary windings, clearances of basic insulation on the secondary side shall be not less than those specified in Table 16, using the next lower step for rated impulse voltage as a reference.NOTE 2 The use of an isolating transformer without an earthed protective screen or earthed secondary does not allow a reduction in the rated impulse voltage.For circuits supplied with a voltage lower than rated voltage, for example on the secondary side of a transformer, clearances of functional insulation are based on the working voltage, which is used as the rated voltage in Table 15.Compliance is checked by measurement.Appliances shall be constructed so that creepage distances are not less than those appropriate for the working voltage, taking into account the material group and the pollution degree.NOTE 1 The working voltage for parts connected to the neutral is the same as for parts connected to the phase and this is the working voltage for basic insulation.Pollution degree 2 applies unlessprecautions have been taken to protect the insulation, in which case pollution degree 1 applies;the insulation is subjected to conductive pollution, in which case pollution degree 3 applies.NOTE 2 An explanation of pollution degree is given in Annex M.Compliance is checked by measurement.NOTE 3 The way in which creepage distances are measured is specified in IEC 60664-1.Parts such as hexagonal nuts that can be tightened to different positions during assembly, and movable parts are placed in the most unfavourable position.A force is applied to bare conductors, other than those of heating elements, and accessible surfaces to try to reduce creepage distances when making the measurement. The force is2 N, for bare conductors;30 N, for accessible surfaces.The force is applied by means of test probe B of IEC 61032.The relationship between the material group and the comparative tracking index (CTI) values, as given in Subclause 4.8.1.3 of IEC 60664-1, is as follows:material group I: 600 \u2264 CTI;material group II: 400 \u2264 CTI < 600;60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010 \u2013 93 \u2013material group IIIa: 175 \u2264 CTI < 400;material group IIIb: 100 \u2264 CTI < 175.These CTI values are obtained in accordance with IEC 60112 using solution A. If the CTI value of the material is unknown, a proof tracking index (PTI) test in accordance with Annex N is carried out at the CTI values specified, in order to establish the material group.NOTE 4 The test for comparative tracking index (CTI) in accordance with IEC 60112 is designed to compare the performance of various insulating materials under test conditions, namely drops of an aqueous contaminant falling on a horizontal surface leading to electrolytic conduction. It gives a qualitative comparison but in the case of insulating materials having a tendency to form tracks, it can also give a quantitative comparison, namely the comparative tracking index.NOTE 5 The procedure for assessing creepage distances is given in Annex L.In a double insulation system, the working voltage for both the basic insulation and supplementary insulation is taken as the working voltage across the complete double insulation system. It is not divided according to thickness and dielectric constants of the basic insulation and supplementary insulation.Creepage distances of basic insulation shall not be less than those specified in Table 17. However, if the working voltage is periodic and has a frequency that exceeds 30 kHz, the creepage distances shall also be determined from Table 2 of IEC 60664-4. These values shall be used instead if they exceed the values in Table 17.Except for pollution degree 1, if the test of Clause 14 has been used to check a particular clearance, the corresponding creepage distance shall not be less than the minimum dimension specified for the clearance of Table 16.\u2013 94 \u2013 60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010Table 17 \u2013  Minimum creepage distances for basic insulationWorking voltageVCreepage distancemmPollution degree123Material groupMaterial groupIIIIIIa/IIIbIIIIIIa/IIIb a\u2264 50125250400500>630 and \u2264800>800 and \u22641 000>1 000 and \u22641 250>1 250 and \u22641 600>1 600 and \u22642 000>2 000 and \u22642 500>2 500 and \u22643 200>3 200 and \u22644 000>4 000 and \u22645 000>5 000 and \u22646 300>6 300 and \u22648 000>8 000 and \u226410 000>10 000 and \u226412 5000,180,280,561,01,31,82,43,24,25,67,510,012,516,020,025,032,040,00,60,751,252,02,53,24,05,06,38,010,012,516,020,025,032,040,050,00,851,051,82,83,64,55,67,19,011,014,018,022,028,036,045,056,071,01,21,52,54,05,06,38,010,012,516,020,025,032,040,050,063,080,0100,01,51,93,25,06,38,010,012,516,020,025,032,040,050,063,080,0100,0125,01,72,13,65,67,19,011,014,018,022,028,036,045,056,071,090,0110,0140,01,92,44,06,38,010,012,516,020,025,032,040,050,063,080,0100,0125,0160,0NOTE 1 Lacquered conductors of windings are considered to be bare conductors, but creepage distancesneed not be greater than the associated clearance specified in Table 16 taking into account 29.1.1.NOTE 2 For glass, ceramics and other inorganic insulating  materials  that  do not  track,  creepage  distances need not be greater than the associated clearance.NOTE 3 Except for circuits on the secondary side of an isolating transformer, the working voltage is considered to be not less than the rated voltage of the appliance.NOTE 4   For working voltages >  50  V  and \u2264  630 V, if  the  voltage is  not specified in the  table, the values   of creepage distances may be found by interpolation.a Material group IIIb is allowed if the working voltage does not exceed 50 V.Compliance is checked by measurement.Creepage distances of supplementary insulation shall be at least those specified for basic insulation in Table 17 or Table 2 of IEC 60664-4, as applicable.NOTE Notes 1 and 2 of Table 17 do not apply.Compliance is checked by measurement.Creepage distances of reinforced insulation shall  be at least  double those specified for basic insulation in Table 17 or Table 2 of IEC 60664-4, as applicable.NOTE Notes 1 and 2 of Table 17 do not apply.Compliance is checked by measurement.60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010 \u2013 95 \u2013Creepage distances of functional insulation shall be not less than those specified in Table 18.

They are normally carried out on the complete appliance after assembly but the manufacturer may perform the tests at an appropriate stage during production, provided that later manufacturing processes do not affect the results.NOTE Components are not subjected to these tests if they have been previously subjected to routine tests during their manufacture.The manufacturer may use a different routine test procedure provided that the level of safety is equivalent to that provided by the tests specified in this annex.These tests are the minimum considered necessary to cover essential safety aspects. It is the manufacturer\u2019s responsibility to decide if additional routine tests are necessary. It may be determined from engineering considerations that some of the tests are impracticable or inappropriate and therefore need not be carried out.If a product fails any of the tests, it is to be retested after rework or adjustment.Earth continuity testA current of at least 10 A, derived from a source having a no-load voltage not exceeding 12 V (a.c. or d.c.), is passed between each of the accessible earthed metal parts andfor class 0I appliances, and for class I appliances intended to be permanently connected to fixed wiring, the earthing terminal;for other class I appliances,the earthing pin or earthing contact of the plug;the earthing pin of the appliance inlet.The voltage drop is measured and the resistance is calculated and shall not exceedfor appliances having a supply cord, 0,2 \u03a9, or 0,1 \u03a9 plus the resistance of the supply cord;\u2013 for other appliances, 0,1 \u03a9.NOTE 1 The test is only carried out for the duration necessary to enable the voltage drop to be measured.NOTE 2 Care is to be taken to ensure that the contact resistance between the tip of the measuring probe and the metal part under test does not influence the test results.Electric strength testThe insulation of the appliance is subjected to a voltage of substantially sinusoidal waveform having a frequency of approximately 50 Hz or 60 Hz for 1 s. The value of the test voltage and the points of application are shown in Table A.1.\u2013 116 \u2013 60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010Table A.1 \u2013 Test voltagesPoints of applicationTest voltageVClass 0 appliances, Class 0I appliances,Class I appliances and Class II appliancesClass III appliancesRated voltage400\u2013\u2264150 V>150 VBetween live parts andaccessible metal parts separated from live parts by8002 0001 0002 500a This test is not applicable for class 0 appliances.b For class 0I appliances and class I appliances, this test need not be carried out on  parts  of  class  II  construction if the test is considered to be inappropriate.basic insulation onlydouble or reinforced insulation a, bNOTE 1 It may be necessary for the appliance to be in operation during the test to ensure that the test voltage is applied to all relevant insulation, for example, heating elements controlled by a relay.No breakdown shall occur. Breakdown is assumed to occur when the current in the test circuit exceeds 5 mA. However, this limit may be increased up to 30 mA for appliances with a high leakage current.NOTE 2 The circuit used for the test incorporates a current sensing device that trips when the current exceeds the limit.NOTE 3 The high voltage transformer is to be capable of maintaining the specified voltage at the limiting current.NOTE 4 Instead of being subjected to an a.c. voltage, the insulation may be subjected to a d.c. voltage of 1,5 times the value shown in the table. An a.c. voltage having a frequency up to 5 Hz is considered to be a d.c. voltage.Functional testThe correct functioning of an appliance is checked by inspection or by an appropriate test if the incorrect connection or adjustment of components has safety implications.NOTE Examples are verification of the correct direction of motor rotation and the appropriate operation of interlock switches.

The macro- environment, however, has to be taken into account when considering the microenvironment.Means may be provided to reduce pollution at the insulation under consideration by effective use of enclosures, encapsulation or hermetic sealing. Such means to reduce pollution may not be effective when the equipment is subjected to condensation or if in normal use, it generates pollutants itself.Small clearances can be bridged completely by solid particles, dust and water and therefore minimum clearances are specified where pollution may be present in the microenvironment.NOTE 1 Pollution will become conductive in the presence of humidity. Pollution caused by contaminated water, soot, metal or carbon dust is inherently conductive.NOTE 2 Conductive pollution by ionized gases and metallic depositions occur only in specific instances, for example in arc chambers of switchgear or controlgear and is not covered by IEC 60664-1.Degrees of pollution in the microenvironmentFor the purpose of evaluating creepage distances, the following four degrees of pollution in the microenvironment are established:pollution degree 1: no pollution or only dry, non-conductive pollution occurs. The pollution has no influence;pollution degree 2: only non-conductive pollution occurs, except that occasionally a temporary conductivity caused by condensation is to be expected;pollution degree 3: conductive pollution occurs or dry non-conductive pollution occurs that becomes conductive due to condensation that is to be expected;pollution degree 4: the pollution generates persistent conductivity caused by conductive dust or by rain or snow.NOTE 3 Pollution degree 4 is not applicable to appliances.60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010 \u2013 137 \u2013Annex N(normative)Proof tracking testThe proof tracking test is carried out in accordance with IEC 60112 with the following modifications.7 Test apparatus7.3 Test solutionsTest solution A is used.Determination of proof tracking index (PTI)ProcedureModification:The proof voltage is 100 V, 175 V, 400 V or 600 V, as appropriate.

Overvoltage category is a numeral defining a transient overvoltage condition.Equipment of overvoltage category IV is for use at the origin of the installation.NOTE 1 Examples of such equipment are electricity meters and primary overcurrent protection equipment.Equipment of overvoltage category III is equipment in fixed installations and for cases where the reliability and the availability of the equipment is subject to special requirements.NOTE 2 Examples of such equipment are switches in the fixed installation and equipment for industrial use with permanent connection to the fixed installation.Equipment of overvoltage category II is energy consuming equipment to be supplied from the fixed installation.NOTE 3 Examples of such equipment are appliances, portable tools and other household and similar loads.If such equipment  is subjected  to special requirements with regard  to reliability and availability, overvoltage category III applies.Equipment of overvoltage category I is equipment for connection to circuits in which measures are taken to limit transient overvoltages to an appropriately low level.\u2013 132 \u2013 60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010Annex L(informative)Guidance for the measurement of clearances and creepage  distancesWhen measuring clearances, the following applies.The rated voltage and overvoltage category are determined (see Annex K).NOTE 1 In general, appliances are in overvoltage category II.The rated impulse voltage is determined from Table 15.If pollution degree 3 is applicable, or if the appliance is class 0 or class 01, the clearances for basic insulation and functional insulation are measured and compared with the minimum values specified in Table 16. For other cases, the impulse voltage test may be carried out if the rigidity requirements of 29.1 are met, otherwise the values specified in Table 16 apply. However, for functional insulation that is subjected to a steady-state voltage or recurring peak voltage with a frequency not exceeding 30 kHz, the clearances are also obtained from Table F.7a in IEC 60664-1 or if the frequency exceeds 30 kHz, Clause 4 in IEC 60664-4. The larger of the values so obtained is applied if they exceed the minimum values specified in Table 16.Clearances of supplementary insulation and reinforced insulation are measured and compared with the minimum values specified in Table 16.NOTE 2 Special considerations apply for clearances subjected to higher working voltages than rated voltage.

A particular creepage distance is then compared with the corresponding clearance of Table 16 and enlarged if necessary in order not to be less than the clearance. For pollution degree 1, the reduced clearance based on the impulse voltage test can be used. However, the creepage distance can not be less than the values of Table 17.The creepage distances of functional insulation are measured and compared with the minimum values specified in Table 18 or for periodic working voltages exceeding 30 kHz Table 2 of IEC 60664-4.The creepage distances of reinforced insulation are measured and compared with twice the minimum values specified in Table 17.NOTE The sequence for determining creepage distances is shown in Figure L.2.60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010 \u2013 135 \u2013Working voltageMaterial groupPollution degreeBasic insulation (Table 17 or Table 2 in IEC 60664-4as applicable)Supplementary insulation(as obtained for basic insulation from  Table 17 or Table 2 inIEC 60664-4 asapplicable)Functional insulation (larger of Table 18 or for periodic working voltages > 30 kHz in  Table 2 ofIEC 60664-4)Reinforced insulation (29.2.3)Impulse voltage test on clearanceClearancefrom Table 16Pollution degree 2, 3Pollution degree 1Clearancefrom Table 16Creepage distanceFigure L.2 \u2013 Sequence for the determination of creepage distancesIEC 561/01\u2013 136 \u2013 60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010Annex M(normative)Pollution degreeThe following information on pollution degrees is extracted from IEC 60664-1.PollutionThe microenvironment determines the effect of pollution on the insulation. The macro- environment, however, has to be taken into account when considering the microenvironment.Means may be provided to reduce pollution at the insulation under consideration by effective use of enclosures, encapsulation or hermetic sealing. Such means to reduce pollution may not be effective when the equipment is subjected to condensation or if in normal use, it generates pollutants itself.Small clearances can be bridged completely by solid particles, dust and water and therefore minimum clearances are specified where pollution may be present in the microenvironment.NOTE 1 Pollution will become conductive in the presence of humidity. Pollution caused by contaminated water, soot, metal or carbon dust is inherently conductive.NOTE 2 Conductive pollution by ionized gases and metallic depositions occur only in specific instances, for example in arc chambers of switchgear or controlgear and is not covered by IEC 60664-1.Degrees of pollution in the microenvironmentFor the purpose of evaluating creepage distances, the following four degrees of pollution in the microenvironment are established:pollution degree 1: no pollution or only dry, non-conductive pollution occurs. The pollution has no influence;pollution degree 2: only non-conductive pollution occurs, except that occasionally a temporary conductivity caused by condensation is to be expected;pollution degree 3: conductive pollution occurs or dry non-conductive pollution occurs that becomes conductive due to condensation that is to be expected;pollution degree 4: the pollution generates persistent conductivity caused by conductive dust or by rain or snow.NOTE 3 Pollution degree 4 is not applicable to appliances.60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010 \u2013 137 \u2013Annex N(normative)Proof tracking testThe proof tracking test is carried out in accordance with IEC 60112 with the following modifications.7 Test apparatus7.3 Test solutionsTest solution A is used.Determination of proof tracking index (PTI)ProcedureModification:The proof voltage is 100 V, 175 V, 400 V or 600 V, as appropriate.

incorporating measures to control the fault/error conditions specified ", "The following information on pollution degrees is extracted from IEC 60664-1.PollutionThe microenvironment determines the effect of pollution on the insulation. The macro- environment, however, has to be taken into account when considering the microenvironment.Means may be provided to reduce pollution at the insulation under consideration by effective use of enclosures, encapsulation or hermetic sealing. Such means to reduce pollution may not be effective when the equipment is subjected to condensation or if in normal use, it generates pollutants itself.Small clearances can be bridged completely by solid particles, dust and water and therefore minimum clearances are specified where pollution may be present in the microenvironment.NOTE 1 Pollution will become conductive in the presence of humidity. Pollution caused by contaminated water, soot, metal or carbon dust is inherently conductive.NOTE 2 Conductive pollution by ionized gases and metallic depositions occur only in specific instances, for example in arc chambers of switchgear or controlgear and is not covered by IEC 60664-1.Degrees of pollution in the microenvironmentFor the purpose of evaluating creepage distances, the following four degrees of pollution in the microenvironment are established:pollution degree 1: no pollution or only dry, non-conductive pollution occurs. The pollution has no influence;pollution degree 2: only non-conductive pollution occurs, except that occasionally a temporary conductivity caused by condensation is to be expected;pollution degree 3: conductive pollution occurs or dry non-conductive pollution occurs that becomes conductive due to condensation that is to be expected;pollution degree 4: the pollution generates persistent conductivity caused by conductive dust or by rain or snow.NOTE 3 Pollution degree 4 is not applicable to appliances.60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010 \u2013 137 \u2013", "The proof tracking test is carried out in accordance with IEC 60112 with the following modifications.7 Test apparatus7.3 Test solutionsTest solution A is used.Determination of proof tracking index (PTI)ProcedureModification:The proof voltage is 100 V, 175 V, 400 V or 600 V, as appropriate.

Sufficient samples of the product shall be provided to conduct all of the tests required. Products may be tested as a complete assembly or the separate components or sub-assemblies may be tested individually. For test results from components or sub-assemblies to be acceptable, the sum of the tested exposures shall be equal to or greater than the actual exposures of the complete assembly, except for the growth of micro-organisms test, where the tested exposure shall be in the range of 1000 mm 2 /L to 15 000 mm 2 /L. NOTE: Care should be taken in considering the approval of materials that are not in final product form. The performance of materials is affected by the processing conditions, which may influence results of the tests described in this Standard. Any changes in the material formulation, the process of manufacture, the method of application, or the surface area-to-volume ratio in end use could affect the suitability of the product for use in contact with drinking water and re-testing may be required. 4.2 Range of product sizes Where a manufacturer produces a complete range of product sizes of the same material composition, tests on the greatest surface area-to-volume ratio product shall qualify the remainder of the range, provided that the same manufacturing conditions and processes are used for the complete range of products. 4.3   Product exposure Wherever possible, samples of the product shall be tested by in-the-product exposure (see Paragraph A4.1), so that only the surface that is normally wetted in end use is exposed to the test water. Where in-the-product exposure is not possible, or where unfabricated material is being tested, the product surface or a representative sample of the material surface shall be tested by immersion exposure (see Paragraph A4.2). The ratio of exposed surface area to extractant water volume for immersion exposure testing shall be equal to (within 5%) or greater than the surface area-to-volume ratio in the intended end use, and shall not be less than 1000 mm2 /L. Where testing for the growth of micro-organisms, the ratio shall be in the range 22 21000 mm /L to 15 000 mm /L. Where the end-use exposure is greater than 15 000 mm /L, the test result shall be based on a testing exposure of 15 000 mm 2 /L and no scaling factor shall be applied to this result. Where a product has multiple non-metallic components, the non-metallic wetted components shall be tested at the end-use exposure, with the exception that end-of-line fittings shall be tested at an exposure for each component in contact with 250 mL of water. The MDOD result shall be the average of results for individual components.", "5.1   General Scaling factors are normally specified in the relevant product Standard. The discussion below applies to situations in which this is not the case. Flexible hoses are tested as end-of-line fittings unless otherwise specified in the relevant product Standard. A scaling factor is generally not applicable to in-the-product testing (e.g. the testing of pipe). In this method of exposure, the ratio of the exposed surface area to the extractant water volume will in most cases be equal to the surface area-to-volume ratio in end use (i.e. a scaling factor of 1). An exception applies in certain cases of in-the-product testing, where in end use the internal surface of the product is effectively in contact with a substantially larger volume of water than in the test. Examples of such products are valves and fittings connected into water supply pipelines. A further exception applies in the testing of end-of-line-fittings such as taps and their components, where in the end-use situation the extract contained in the fitting is effectively diluted before consumption. Similarly, the use of a composite extract in the metals extraction test for end-of-line fittings has the effect of providing an inbuilt scaling factor. In immersion exposure testing, the selected surface-area-to-volume ratio in the test can be greater than in the intended end use. Where this is the case, a scaling factor having a value of less than 1 may be applied in the evaluation of the test result. For end-of-line fittings requiring the total immersion procedure, the fitting is tested in 250 mL of test water. In addition, the testing exposure shall be not less than 1000 mm 2 /L. Scaling factors cannot be applied to qualify products for end-use surface area-to-volume ratios higher than the test ratio, i.e. the scaling factor cannot be greater than 1. Scaling factors can be used only to qualify products for use at surface area-to-volume ratios lower than the test ratio. 5.2   Determination of scaling factors Where a scaling factor is applied in either immersion exposure testing or in-the-product testing, the value of this scaling factor will have been agreed between the manufacturer and the testing laboratory. Where product certification is required, the agreed scaling factor needs to be acceptable to the certifying body. The scaling factor specified shall be in the range 0.01 to 1.0 and shall apply to all tests. The test report shall include the value and method of derivation of the scaling factor. NOTE: Examples of the method of scaling factor calculation in some typical product applications are given in Appendix B.  In the case of domestic plumbing fittings, a scaling factor based on the layout in Figure B1 will apply, unless the manufacturer presents another valid approach. 5.3 Application of scaling factors (see Paragraph B3 Example 1) The scaling factor shall be applied by sample size selection (to produce the surface area-tovolume ratio applicable to the end-use situation) and/or by the application of the scaling factor to each test. Where used for a test, the scaling factor shall be applied as follows: (a) Taste The extract is diluted with fresh extractant water in proportion to the scaling factor. (b) Appearance The extract is diluted in proportion to the scaling factor or, alternatively, the concentration of each colour and/or turbidity value in the extract is multiplied by the scaling factor. (c) Growth of micro-organisms The mean dissolved oxygen difference is multiplied by the scaling factor. (d) Cytotoxic and mutagenic activity The extract is diluted with fresh extractant water in proportion to the scaling factor. (e) Extraction of metals The extract is diluted with fresh extractant water in proportion to the scaling factor or, alternatively, the concentration of each metal in the extract is multiplied by the scaling factor. 5.4 Restrictions on the use of scaling factors The uncertainty of measurement in laboratory testing will increase as the amount of dilution of the extract increases. As a practical limit, the maximum allowable dilution of the extract prior to assessment for taste, appearance, cytotoxic and mutagenic activity, and extraction of metals (Appendices C, D, F, G and H) shall not exceed 1 part extract to 99 parts fresh extractant water. Similarly, a scaling factor applied to the test result in the appearance test (see Clause 5.3(b)) or the extraction of metals test (see Clause 5.3(e)) shall not have a value of less than 0.01. In the growth of micro-organisms test (see Clause 5.3(c)), the scaling factor applied to the test result shall not have a value of less than 0.33. NOTE: Where a scaling factor of less than 0.33 is required for the growth of micro-organisms test, adjustment of the surface area-to-volume ratio is necessary prior to testing.", "6.1   General Products for use in contact with drinking water shall be subjected to tests for taste, appearance, growth of aquatic micro-organisms, cytotoxicity, mutagenicity and extraction of metals, dependent on whether the type of product is in-line, end-of-line or hot water system, in accordance with Table 1 and the methods given in Appendices C to K, as appropriate. The results of these tests shall comply with the criteria set out below. Testing shall be undertaken unless specifically excluded by the relevant product standard. NOTE: As experience in the use of this Standard increases, a list of products exempt from testing may be developed. NOTES: 1 \u2018Metallic pipes and fittings\u2019 are defined as those products that contain only wetted metallic components as part of the complete assembly. 2 The microbial test is undertaken for products that contain non-metallic wetted components. Testing of the products is usually conducted at 30\u00b0C and covers products that operate at less than 40\u00b0C (see Appendix E). 3 N/A: Test is not required. 6.2 Taste of water extract When the product is tested in accordance with Appendix C, if a reportable taste is detected by any member of the taste panel in the first dilution of the first and/or seventh chlorinated or unchlorinated extract, the product shall be deemed unsuitable for contact with drinking water unless two further samples are examined and each panellist reports no taste in the first dilution of the final (i.e. seventh) chlorinated or unchlorinated extract from these samples. 6.3   Appearance of water extract When the product is tested in accordance with Appendix D, the increase in true colour and turbidity of the water in the first extract shall be less than five Hazen Units (HU) and 0.5 Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTU) respectively. If a single sample does not comply with this requirement after a seventh extract, the product shall be deemed unsuitable for contact with drinking water unless three further samples are examined and the mean colour and turbidity of their final (i.e. seventh) extracts are not increased by more than 5 HU or 0.5 NTU respectively. 6.4   Growth of aquatic micro-organisms When the product is tested in accordance with Appendix E, the mean dissolved oxygen difference (MDOD) shall be less than or equal to 2.4 mg/L. If a single sample of a product gives an MDOD in the range 1.7 mg/L to 2.9 mg/L inclusive, two further samples of the product shall be examined. If the arithmetic mean of the three MDOD values is greater than 2.4 mg/L, the product shall be deemed unsuitable for contact with drinking water. 6.5 Cytotoxic activity of water extract When the product is tested in accordance with Appendix F, the extract shall not cause a cytotoxic response. If a single sample gives a cytotoxic response, two further samples of the product shall be examined using fresh reagents. 6.6   Mutagenic activity of water extract The product shall be tested in accordance with Appendix G and the test result shall be reported. If a single sample gives a statistically significant result, two further samples shall be extracted using fresh reagents and the reversion test repeated with the same strain of bacterium. A positive result shall be confirmed by testing for mutagenicity of the extract using the alternative micro-organism test system. NOTE: The reliability of the test for mutagenic activity is currently under investigation. Whereas there is still a requirement to report the result of this test, that test result should not at this time form the basis for overall failure of the sample. 6.7   Extraction of metals 6.7.1 Products in general When the product is tested in accordance with Appendices H to J, the amounts of the specified metals in the first and/or final extracts shall not exceed the limits given in Table 2. NOTE: The limits give in Table 2 are subject to adjustment from time to time. The latest available concentrations should be obtained from the Australian Drinking Water Guidelines (ADWG) and the Drinking Water Standards for New Zealand (DWSNZ). If the limit for any metal is exceeded in the final (seventh) extract from any of the duplicate samples, the product shall be deemed unsuitable for contact with drinking water unless a further three samples are examined and the mean of the specified metals in their final seventh extracts does not exceed the limits specified in Table 2. Where the product tested is applied to a metal fitting, the assessment shall be made on the differences in concentrations of the specified metals between the final extracts and the metal-fitting blank test. Where a cementitious product has been tested, the assessment shall be made on the differences in concentrations of the specified metals between the final extracts and the reagent blank test. 6.7.2 End-of-line fittings A procedure for testing end-of-line fittings for extraction of metals is given in Appendix I. If either of the duplicate samples exceeds the concentration limits specified in Table 2, a further three fresh samples of the product shall be examined. The product shall be deemed to pass the test if the mean of the specified metals for all samples does not exceed the limits given in Table 2.", "Where products are designed for use in hot water installations and the water in contact with the product surfaces meets the definition given in Clause 3.5, products shall be tested in accordance with Appendix J or K. The manufacturer of the product is responsible for nominating the maximum holding temperature of the water contained in the product, within the range 40\u00b0C to 100\u00b0C inclusive.

It is for this reason that this method is concerned with taste alone.C3 PRINCIPLEA sample of the product is exposed to chlorine-free test water for 24 h and the extract is then diluted and assessed by a taste panel. If any panellist reports a taste in the first dilution, the same samples are exposed to the test water for a further six sequential periods, including one 72 h period and concluding with a 24 h period, fresh chlorine-free test water being used for each period.

STANDARD MICROBIOLOGICAL PROCEDURES SHOULD BE FOLLOWED THROUGHOUT.Materials containing organic substances (as ingredients, contaminants or process by- products) that are capable of being utilized by micro-organisms can give rise to a noticeable deterioration in the quality of the water with which they are in contact. This deterioration may manifest itself as a change in the organoleptic, physical or microbiological characteristics of water. Microbial growth may occur in the water or at the material-water interface. The phenomenon is distinct from that of microbial attachment, which can occur on the surface of any type of material. If utilizable substances leach out of the material into the water, the growth will be self-limiting and decline in proportion to the rate of leaching. Growths on such materials have been found to persist for periods from 18 months to three years. Where the utilizable substance is bound within or to the material, growths can persist indefinitely.Materials capable of supporting microbial growth do not give rise to an observable deterioration in water quality in every situation. This is due to the influence of various environmental factors, particularly temperature and the presence of residual chlorine. However, in plumbing systems the water temperature is rarely low enough to inhibit microbial growth, and the low level of residual chlorine present in public water supplies will not exert any appreciable bacteriocidal or bacteriostatic action once the water is within the customer\u2019s piping.Drinking water has been treated to ensure the absence of pathogens that give rise to enteric disease, but it is not sterile. The numbers and types of harmless micro-organisms present in drinking water vary considerably, and the natural flora comprise many strains that are adapted to living in a relatively hostile environment. Such organisms differ in their physiological capacity from strains of the same organism found in other environments or grown in the laboratory. Tests using natural strains of aquatic organisms have given responses that correlate well with the occurrence of problems in practice, whereas the responses of laboratory cultures have not given reliable predictions of the performance of a material in practice.There is no technique, based on growing micro-organisms on or in culture media, that enumerates all the aquatic micro-organisms present in a sample of water. Thus the overall number of micro-organisms can be assessed only by an indirect measurement of their activity. The method of assessing microbial activity in the test system described in this Appendix is the measurement of dissolved oxygen uptake. The organisms that give rise to appreciable microbial growth respire aerobically and exert an influence on the levels of oxygen dissolved in the water in the test systems.", "TEST METHOD\u2014CYTOTOXIC ACTIVITY OF WATER EXTRACT(Normative)F1 SCOPEThis Appendix sets out qualitative and quantitative methods for cytotoxicity testing of all products used in contact with drinking water.F2 PRINCIPLEF2.1 GeneralLicensed to Mr LIM YH on 4 December 2009. 1 user personal user licence only. Storage, distribution or use on network prohibited (10074895).A sample of the product is exposed to test water for 24 h. The exposures are repeated using fresh water for one further 48-hour period, followed by one 72-hour period.An aliquot from each product extract is used in the preparation of a nutrient medium for the growth of mammalian cells.Blank extracts, negative and positive controls are assessed in parallel with the sample extracts. Assessment of cytotoxicity is achieved by comparing identical time points of the product extracts with their relative blanks. Alternatively, evidence of a cytotoxic response is determined when the morphology of the cell line is affected by the sample extracts.F2.2 Qualitative determination of cytotoxicity by microscopyThe morphology of cells grown in the presence of the product extracts is observed and compared to those of the blank extracts.F2.3 Quantitative determination of cytotoxicity by endpoint assayCytotoxicity can be determined quantitatively by measuring cell viability via an endpoint assay. The use of 1-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-3,5-diphenylformazan (MTT) is one such example. In the presence of active cellular mitochondrial reductases, MTT is reduced from the soluble yellow tetrazolium salt into insoluble purple formazan crystals. Dissolving the cells and crystals in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) creates a homogeneous solution, the absorbance of which is measured at 570 nm (reference at 630 nm). Absorbance is directly proportional to cell viability. The cytotoxicity of the extracts is quantified using a cytotoxicity standard curve and quality control standards. These are included to ensure correct performance of the assay.F3 TEST PREMISESBoth procedures shall be carried out only by persons having experience in tissue culture and microscopic examination of cell morphology.NOTES:1 The test should be carried out in a suitable biohazard cabinet.2 The nutrient media used in this test are capable of supporting microbial growth and the cell line is capable of being infected by human viruses.WARNING: AS WELL AS OBSERVING SAFE WORKING PRACTICES, PARTICULAR CARE IS NECESSARY IN HANDLING CONTINUOUS CELL LINES BECAUSE THEY MAY BECOME INFECTED WITH PATHOGENIC VIRUSES AND BACTERIA DURING THE COURSE OF THEIR MANIPULATION.F4 REAGENTS", "TEST METHOD\u2014MUTAGENIC ACTIVITY OF WATER EXTRACT(Normative)G1 SCOPEThis Appendix sets out a method for bacterial mutagenicity testing of leachates from all products used in contact with drinking water.G2 PRINCIPLELicensed to Mr LIM YH on 4 December 2009. 1 user personal user licence only. Storage, distribution or use on network prohibited (10074895).The Ames test is a reverse mutation assay using Salmonella typhimurium. An alternative system uses Escherichia coli. The assay uses a pre-incubation plate incorporation method. A reverse-mutation assay detects mutation in a gene of an amino acid-requiring bacterial strain, the result of which is to produce an amino acid-independent strain. This assay is based on OECD Guidelines 471 and 472 and the Ames test as reviewed by Maron and Ames (1983).*The Salmonella typhimurium histidine (His) reversion system is a microbial assay, which\u2212measures His+to Hisreversion induced by chemicals that cause base changes or frameshiftmutations in the genome of this organism.The Escherichia coli tryptophan (Trp) reversion system is a microbial assay, which\u2212measures Trp+to Trpreversion induced by chemicals that cause mutations in the genomeof this organism.The assay used incorporates a pre-incubation step in which the bacteria are exposed to the test substance with a metabolic activation system prior to addition of top agar and overlaying onto a defined minimal medium agar plate. The assay also uses a direct addition to the top agar overlay where no metabolic activation is attempted. After a suitable period of incubation, revertant colonies are counted and compared with the number of spontaneous revertants in a blank extract control culture. For the purposes of this Standard, separate tests with one of the two systems are used to determine the absence of substances that give rise to a mutagenic response. If a mutagenic response is detected in one system of reverse- mutation assay, confirmation in the other system is required (i.e. if an extract is mutagenic using the Salmonella typhimurium system, mutagenicity is confirmed using a suitable Escherichia coli system and vice versa).G3 TEST PREMISESCultures and media shall be manipulated in a laboratory having a biologically clean atmosphere that is dust free, and the test shall be carried out in an environment that avoids contamination of the bacteria culture. The testing should be carried out in a suitable biohazard cabinet conforming with AS 2567 where appropriate.G4 REAGENTSG4.1 Test waterPrepared as described in Paragraph C5.1.1 except for the testing of cementitious products (see Paragraph A8).* MARON, D.M. and AMES, B.N. \u2018Revised methods for the Salmonella mutagenicity test\u2019.

Where the fitting is in contact with cold and hot water, the method takes into account hot and cold cycles and the transient nature of water temperature. It also uses a scaling factor of less than 1, as the extract contained in the fitting is in practice dispersed into a larger total volume of water when the water is consumed.Licensed to Mr LIM YH on 4 December 2009. 1 user personal user licence only. Storage, distribution or use on network prohibited (10074895).The test for growth of aquatic micro-organisms is undertaken using the extraction procedures described in Appendix E.For methods of analysis of the extracts, refer to the appropriate appendices.I2 PRINCIPLEIn-the-product exposure is used wherever possible for the test extractions (A4.1), so that the sample of the fitting is completely filled with the test water (extractant water) to cover the surface area-to-volume ratio in end use. For Appendices C, D, F and G, at the completion of the appropriate contact period, which may include an initial maximum temperature exposure (for fittings used for the distribution of water that is \u226540\u00b0C), the volume held in the test fitting is collected, and made up to a final volume of 250 mL prior to analysis.Immersion exposure (A4.2) is used for fittings such as tap components that cannot be evaluated by in-the-product exposure and can be installed within 250 mL draw-off of adrinking water delivery point. In such cases, the test fitting is totally immersed in 250 mL2of extractant water at not less than 1000 mm /L test water.Immersion exposure applies also for extraction of metals (see Appendix H) in cases where fittings and components cannot be tested for metals using the test rig (I3.1).The test rig is used to test for extraction of metals (see Appendix H) in end-of-line fittings.The test rig comprises a suitable water storage container and heater (hot tests) connected via a pipe to an isolation valve, which is then connected via a pipe to the test fitting. The extractant water is brought into contact with the fitting materials up to the closing mechanism or, if this does not exist, the outlet end of the fitting, for an extended contact period. This period simulates overnight contact of water with an end-of-line fitting in a domestic situation. After the contact period, aliquots of water are drawn from the fitting over a 3.5 h period and the aliquots combined and tested as a composite test extract for the relevant metals (see Table 2).I3 APPARATUSI3.1 Test rig (for test procedure I6.3)The test rig is constructed of materials shown not to leach materials into the water. The test rig comprises a water storage vessel suitable for containing at least 15 L of extractant water and a connecting valve and pipe. For testing end-of-line fittings for the hot water tests, a suitable method of heating the test water shall be used. A commercial urn, shown not to influence any results, can be used for this purpose.The storage container is connected via a DN 25 diameter fitting to an isolating valve adjacent to the container and then via a DN 25 diameter PE, PP or PB pipe to a threaded junction for the test fitting. The volume contained in the pipe between the isolating valve and the entry to the fitting shall be (350 \u00b110) mL.", "HIGH TEMPERATURE TESTS(Normative)J1 SCOPELicensed to Mr LIM YH on 4 December 2009. 1 user personal user licence only.

Such products, if found to be satisfactory by the other tests described in this Standard, can be tested by the method described in this Appendix if they are intended for use in hot water installations and the water in contact with the product will pass to a draw-off point from which the water is intended for drinking purposes.This Appendix describes the extraction procedure to be used in assessing the ability of a product to impart a discernible taste or any noticeable colour or turbidity to hot water intended for drinking. It is also applicable in assessing the leaching of metals from products in hot water and the extraction from such products of substances that may be of concern to public health. It is not applicable to the test for growth of aquatic micro-organisms (see Appendix E), except where the product is to be used for cold and hot water applications.

Storage, distribution or use on network prohibited (10074895).Components made from a single material may be pre-qualified by a simulated sample that has been tested and shown to meet the requirements of this Standard. The simulated sample is manufactured using the same manufacturing processes and having an envelope of characteristics (e.g. dimensions, surface finish, material composition) within which the components lie. For example, plastic pipe samples would not be represented by compression-moulded samples.M3 TYPICAL EXAMPLES OF SIMULATED SAMPLESThe process of pre-qualification may be applicable to the following types of materials:(a) Metals and metallic alloys.(b) Plastic materials.M4 SPECIAL ISSUESFor assessment purposes, it is critical that the documentation surrounding the simulated sample is comprehensive so that a clear relationship exists between the simulated sample and the component under consideration.A clear description of the simulated sample should include the following:(a) General description including a specific sample number.(b) Material designation, such as\u2014(i) manufacturer, commercial grade of material and reference to the relevant standard; and(ii) where the maximum level of a specific element(s) of the material is critical to the test requirements, a measurement and recording of these elements and their maximum level. The acceptable variation in concentration of specific elements/ingredients in the sample from that allowed in a supplied component should be specified in the product Standard. For example, if the composition of the simulated sample is 71.8%A, 25.0%B, 3.0%C and 0.2%D, the product Standard might accept compositions of: \u2264 75.4%A, \u2264 26.25%B, \u2264 3.15%C,\u2264 0.3%D (and no other ingredients) in a component. This example is based onthall of the ingredients of the component being not more than 1/20 of the valueor 0.1% (whichever is the higher) more than the amounts that were in the simulated sample.(c) The processing used to manufacture the simulated sample should be the same as that used to manufacture the components and should be defined as follows:", "TEST REPORT(Normative)N1 GENERALThe test report shall include the particulars shown in Paragraphs N2 and N3, plus the additional details shown in Paragraph N4 that are specific to the given test.N2 TEST REPORT INFORMATIONLicensed to Mr LIM YH on 4 December 2009. 1 user personal user licence only.

If another measurement distance is used, the report shall include a description of how the limits were calculated.Further guidance is given in Annex F.", "10 Compliance with this publicationCompliance with this publication requires that the EUT satisfies either the Class A or Class B requirements defined in Annex A, as appropriate. An EUT which fulfils the applicable requirements specified in Annex A is deemed to fulfil the requirements in the entire frequency range from 9 kHz to 400 GHz. No measurements need be performed at frequencies where no requirement is specified.Where this publication gives options for measuring particular requirements with a choice of measurement methods, compliance can be shown against any of the specified limits using the appropriate measurement method. In any situation where it is necessary to re-measure the equipment to show compliance with this publication, the measurement method originally chosen shall be used in order to guarantee consistency of the results, unless it is agreed by the manufacturer to do otherwise. Requirements for radiated emission measurements are defined in Table A.2 to Table A.7 with the restrictions and limitations defined in Table A.1. Requirements for conducted emission measurements are defined in Table A.9 to Table A.13 with the restrictions defined in Table A.8.The determination of compliance with this publication shall be based solely on contributions from the EUT. For example, where an AE is required to exercise or monitor the EUT, and emissions from the AE are known to contribute to the overall measured emission of the system being assessed (for example an AE which is a plug-in module for the EUT), the AE selected should, wherever possible, be compliant with relevant emission limits. If the AE is known to cause significant emissions, these emissions may be reduced by mitigation measures, as long as these measures do not reduce the emissions from the EUT. The preferred configuration is that the AE is removed from the measurement area, as allowed by D.1.Compliance can be shown by measuring the EUT\u2019s emissions when operating its functions simultaneously, individually in turn, or any combination thereof.", "11 Measurement uncertaintyThe measurement instrumentation uncertainty shall  be calculated in accordance  with CISPR 16-4-2 and reported as described in Clause 9.Measurement instrumentation uncertainty shall not be taken into account in the determination of compliance.

For example, the keyboard and mouse of a personal computer set-up shall be placed in front of the monitor.The following arrangements may be used to limit the effects of adverse AE emissions or to reduce measurement time, as long as the arrangement can be shown not to reduce the emissions measured from the EUT:\u2022 placing AE below the RGP;\u2022 placing AE below the test volume of a FAR; or,\u2022 placing AE outside the measurement area when it is normally located distant from the EUT.An EUT intended for rack mounting may be arranged in a rack or as table-top equipment. An EUT that can be used in both floor standing and table-top configurations, or both floor standing and wall mounted configurations, shall be assessed in a table-top arrangement. However, if the usual installation is floor standing, then that arrangement shall be used.The type and construction of cables used in the measurement set-up shall be consistent with normal or typical use. Cables with mitigation features (for example, screening, tighter/more twists per length, ferrite beads) shall only be used if it is the intention that all deployments will use these features. If the cable(s) have mitigation features, this detail shall be specified in theCISPR 32:2015 \uf6d9 IEC 2015 \u2013 55 \u2013test report.

The bundle length shall be less than 0,4 m to satisfy the distances given in Table D.2.Non-inductive bundling means that the cable is shortened by overlapping loops arranged with alternate end loops wound in opposite directions using the minimum practicable bend radius. Where bundling cannot be achieved, coiling of the cables shall be avoided.The effective length of all loop-back cables not routed overhead shall be longer than 2 m. Where possible, loop-back cables shall be arranged so that outgoing line is not closely coupled to the return.Where possible, the effective length of mains cables shall be 1 m \u00b1 0,1 m.Cable length is the distance between cable connector ends, excluding any protruding pins, when the cable is laid straight.

The effective cable length will be shorter than the actual length if the cable has been bundled.Loads and/or devices simulating typical operating conditions shall be connected to at least one of each type of interface port of the EUT. If loading (or terminating) with a device of actual usage is not feasible, the port should preferably be loaded with a simulator. Where these options are not practical the port shall be loaded by the application of a typical impedance considering both the common and differential modes.

Where practical, the rear of the EUT should be flush with the rear of the table.For radiated measurements the table shall be made of a material with a dielectric constant which minimises the impact on the results, for example, by the use of unpainted expanded polystyrene. Subclause 5.5.2 of CISPR 16-1-4:2010/AMD1:2012 describes a measurement to help ensure that the dielectric qualities of the material used for construction of the table are appropriate.The arrangement of external power supply units (including AC/DC power converters) shall meet the requirements of Table D.2. Where possible, cables that connect between modules or units shall hang over the back of the table. If a cable hangs closer than 0,4 m from the horizontal RGP (or floor), the excess shall be folded at the cable centre into a bundle no longer than 0,4 m, such that the bundle is 0,4 m above the horizontal RGP.If the mains port input cable is less than 0,8 m long, (including power supplies integrated in the mains plug) an extension cable shall be used such that the external power supply unit is placed on the measurement table. The extension cable shall have similar characteristics to the mains cable (including the number of conductors and the presence of ground connection). The extension cable shall be treated as part of the mains cable.Power supply output cables shall be treated as inter-unit cables.Equipment may be stacked if this is a normal arrangement for this equipment.Example measurement arrangements are given in Figure D.1 to Figure D.5 and Figure D.8.", "D.1.3 Floor standing arrangementWhere cable routing is specified by the manufacturer, this routing shall be used.Where the inter-unit cabling is typically routed overhead, it shall be routed vertically to an overhead support. Overhead inter-unit cables shall rise from the first unit up to the support, run along the support, and drop down into the other unit. Overhead exit cables shall rise from the first unit up to the support, run along the support to a specified distance, drape down to the RGP, and route out of the facility to remote AE. Excess cable shall be bundled non- inductively on, but separated from, the RGP (respecting separation distances as defined in Table D.2).Mains cabling shall drape vertically to (but be insulated from) the horizontal RGP.The EUT shall be insulated (by insulation of maximum thickness of 150 mm) from the horizontal reference ground plane. If the equipment requires a dedicated ground connection, this shall be provided and bonded to the RGP.Examples are given in Figure D.6 and Figure D.9.CISPR 32:2015 \uf6d9 IEC 2015 \u2013 59 \u2013", "D.1.4 Combinations of table-top and floor standing EUT arrangementThe following specific arrangements apply.For the assessment of a combination of table-top and floor standing EUT, two RGPs may be required. The horizontal plane is always the RGP for the floor standing equipment while the RGP for the table-top equipment during conducted emission measurements may be either horizontal or vertical. The inter-unit cables between a table-top unit and a floor standing unit which are long enough to drape on the horizontal RGP shall be non-inductively bundled (or if too short or stiff for bundling, arranged but not-coiled) and placed on the table or supported at 0,4 m or at the height of the lowest cable entry point if this is below 0,4 m.Examples of general arrangements are given in Figure D.7 and Figure D.10.", "D.1.5 Arrangements for radiated measurement in a FARWhere necessary, an access hole should be provided in the centre of the turntable to facilitate routing of cables.Mains power outlets may be placed on the surface of the turntable (or supporting element), if the site validation requirements for the chamber can be met in this configuration.The arrangement of the EUT and local AE shall be identical to those used for measurements using a OATS/SAC/FSOATS except for cables that leave the test area. These cables shall be routed horizontally with a minimum exposed length of 0,8 m, before being routed vertically with a minimum of exposed length of 0,8 m, to the bottom  of the test  volume (See Figure D.12). They shall then be routed to the centre of the turntable where, if possible the cables shall drape vertically downward. The cables shall then leave the chamber by the shortest possible route to minimise any impact. Where the cables are shorter than 1,6 m, as defined by the manufacturer, then the horizontal component shall be as close to 0,8 m as possible.Example measurement arrangements are given in Figure D.11 and Figure D.12.", "D.2 MME-related conditions for conducted emission measurement\u00a0D.2.1 GeneralD.2.2 Specific conditions for table-top equipmentD.2.3 Specific requirements for floor standing equipmentD.2.4 Specific requirements for combined table-top and floor standing equipment", "D.2.1 GeneralDuring measurements of conducted emissions, any required dedicated ground connection of the EUT shall be made to the reference point of the AMN.

All other units of the EUT and AE shall be connected to a second (or multiple) AMN(s). It is acceptable to connect these other equipments to an AMN via extension cables that include one or multiple socket outlets. Where additional socket outlets are needed, the extension shall be as short as practical. All AMNs shall be bonded to a RGP.\u2013 60 \u2013 CISPR 32:2015 \uf6d9 IEC 2015For AMNs mounted below the RGP an extension cable may be used. The AMN specification shall be met at the connection point for the EUT (the end of the extension cable or power strip) with at least 0,8 m spacing between the EUT and the connection point on the extension cable.Where the EUT is a collection of equipment with multiple units, each having its own power cable, the point of connection for the AMN is determined by the following rules:\u2022 for an EUT that has several modules, each with its own power cable (however terminated) and for which the manufacturer provides a power strip (multi-socket mains splitter) with a single power cable for connection to the external power source, a single measurement shall be performed at the mains input to that power cable;\u2022 power cables or terminals which are not specified by the manufacturer to be connected via a host unit shall be measured separately;\u2022 power cables or field wiring terminals (mains input terminals) which are specified by the manufacturer to be connected via a host unit or other power-supplying equipment shall be connected as described by the manufacturer;\u2022 where a special connection is specified, the  necessary hardware to effect  the connection shall be supplied by the manufacturer for the purpose of this measurement.In all other cases the conducted emissions on each individual EUT with its own power cable that is terminated in a power supply plug of a standard design (IEC TR 60083 for example) shall be measured separately.Any AAN used during conducted emission measurements shall be selected and configured to be representative of the network in which the EUT is intended to operate. All ports of the AAN shall be correctly terminated in accordance with D.1. Where the 1 m requirement cannot be achieved, because of the position of the power input port/wired network port, then the effective length shall be as short as possible. In the case of EUTs including floor standing equipment the cable connecting the analogue/digital data port to the AAN may be positioned perpendicular to the EUT for a distance between of 0,3 m and 0,8 m then drop vertically to (but be insulated from) the horizontal RGP before being extended to the AAN. In these cases any bundling may be located on (but be insulated from) the ground plane", "D.2.2 Specific conditions for table-top equipmentThe RGP shall have a minimum size of 2 m by 2 m and shall extend a minimum of 0,5 m beyond the EUT, local AE and associated cabling in all directions.Alternative 1: The measurement shall be performed using a vertical RGP.

This configuration should then be used during formal measurements.The number of configurations to be considered is dependent upon the complexity of the EUT. Therefore, a quick and simple procedure should be established for comparative purposes so that the impact of varying the configuration can be found. Changes in configurations which may be considered include:\u2022 mode of operation, as defined in 3.1.23;\u2022 supply voltage discussed in A.1;\u2022 arrangement discussed in Annex D;\u2022 number and arrangement of modules within a system. See Figure 2;\u2022 number of cables attached applying the criteria in D.1.1;\u2022 position of cables, local AE and HID as required in Annex D.The prescan method attempts to closely emulate the formal procedure so that effective comparisons can be achieved. For example, a limited height SAC would be an appropriate prescan facility followed by an OATS/SAC for formal measurements. An effective prescan will give confidence that the configuration which produces the highest amplitude emission with respect to the limit has been found.Prescan measurements may be performed with spectrum analysers without pre-selection provided that precautions are used to ensure that the instrument is not overloaded.A simple procedure to check for overload is to repeat a measurement with an attenuator (for example, 6 dB) added at a convenient point in the measurement path so that the signal present at any active or nonlinear stage of the measurement path (amplifiers, limiters, receivers, and so forth) is reduced by a known amount. If the measured signal level does not decrease by approximately the value  of the attenuator used (within 0,5 dB),  then  the measurement system may be overloaded and steps should be taken to correct the problem.

This standardisation is necessary in order to obtain  reproducible measurement results, independent of the undefined asymmetric common mode impedance at the AE and the EUT.In general, the asymmetric common mode impedance seen by the EUT at the AE port is not defined unless an AAN is used. If the AE is located outside the shielded room, the asymmetric common mode impedance seen by the EUT at the AE port can be determined by the asymmetric common mode impedance of the feed through-filter between the measurement set-up and the outside world. A \u03c0-type filter has a low common mode impedance whilst a T- type filter has a high asymmetric common mode impedance.AANs do not exist for all types of cables used by MME. It is therefore also necessary to define other (non-invasive) measurement procedures that do not use AANs.Normally, there are several other cables (or ports) present at the EUT. At least the connection to the mains port is present in most cases. The asymmetric common mode impedance of these other connections (including a possible ground connection) and the presence or absence of these connections during the measurement can influence the measurement result significantly, particularly for small EUTs. Therefore the asymmetric common mode impedance of the non-measured connections has to be defined during the assessment of small EUTs. It is sufficient to have, in addition to the port being assessed, at  least two additional ports connected to a 150 \u2126 common mode impedance (normally by using an AAN with the RF\u2013 84 \u2013 CISPR 32:2015 \uf6d9 IEC 2015measurement port terminated with 50 \u2126) in order to reduce this influence to a negligible amount.Coupling devices for non-shielded balanced pairs should also simulate the typical LCL value of the lowest cabling category (worst LCL) specified for the wired network port being measured. The idea of this requirement is to take into account the transformation of the symmetrical signal into a asymmetric common mode signal, which might contribute to possible radiated disturbance when the EUT is used in the real application. Asymmetry in the AAN is deliberately introduced to yield the specified LCL value. This asymmetry may enhance or cancel the asymmetry of the EUT. In the interest of determining the worst case emissions and optimization of measurement repeatability, consideration should therefore be given  to repeating the measurement with the LCL imbalance on each wire of a balanced pair when using the appropriate AAN as defined in C.4.1.2.Since imbalance on each balanced pair will contribute to the total conducted common mode emission, all combinations of imbalance on all balanced pairs should be considered. For a single balanced pair, this has a relatively minor measurement impact \u2013 the two wires are reversed. However, for two balanced pairs, the number of LCL loading combinations (and therefore measurement configurations) is four. For four balanced pairs, the number of loading combinations grows to sixteen. Such numbers have a significant impact on measurement time and measurement documentation. Such measurements are not usually implemented, but if carried out the connection to AAN should be carefully documented.The RF measurement port of an AAN not connected to the measuring receiver should be terminated with 50 \u2126.", "Table G.1 \u2013  Summary of advantages and disadvantages of the procedures described in  C.4.1.6ProcedureC.4.1.6.2C.4.1.6.3C.4.1.6.4AdvantagesFor unscreened cablescontaining balanced pairs, theLCL values of the AAN are within the tolerance in Table C.2 of an AAN appropriate to the cablecategory connected to the EUT.

However, unless the asymmetric common mode impedance seenCISPR 32:2015 \uf6d9 IEC 2015 \u2013 85 \u2013by the EUT at the AE connection is 150 \u2126, the procedure in C.4.1.6.4 will show a result which is in general too high, but never too low (worst case estimation of the emission).", "G.2.3 Basic ideas of the CVPThe method described in C.4.1.6.4 uses a CVP to measure the asymmetric common mode voltage. There are two approaches to the construction of a CVP. For either approach, if a 150 \u2126 common mode impedance is present, the capacitance of the CVP to the cable attached to the EUT port being assessed will appear as a load in parallel with the 150 \u2126 common mode impedance.The common mode impedance tolerance is \u00b120 \u2126 over the frequency range of 0,15 MHz to 30 MHz. If the CVP loading is to reduce the 150 \u2126 common mode impedance down to no less than 130 \u2126, the capacitive loading of the CVP to the cable attached to the EUT port being assessed should be \u22645 pF at 30 MHz (the worst case frequency). At 30 MHz, the impedance of 5 pF is approximately 1 061 \u2126, which, in parallel with 150 \u2126 results in a combined common mode impedance of approximately 131,4 \u2126.A first possible CVP construction approach is for the probe to be a single capacitor that relies on physical distance from the cable attached to the EUT port being measured to achieve the <5 pF loading. This style of CVP is described in 5.2.2 of CISPR 16-1-2:2003/ AMD 1:2004/ AMD 2:2006.A second possible construction uses two coupling devices in series. A first capacitive coupling device in close proximity to the cable attached to the EUT port being assessed (the device is actually in physical contact with the insulation of the cable attached to the EUT port being assessed). The second device is a standard oscilloscope-type voltage probe having an impedance >10 M\u2126 with a probe capacitance <5 pF. The theory is that the probe capacitance in series with the capacitance of the capacitive coupling device presents only the probe capacitance to the cable attached to the EUT port being assessed. In practice, it is possible, given the physical size of the capacitive coupling device, to have a large stray capacitance in parallel with the probe capacitance. If this occurs, the total capacitive loading will be greater than that of the probe itself, and the requirement to have <5 pF loading may be violated. If this technique is employed, the capacitive loading should be verified by measurement and not rely on theory. This capacitance measurement can be made with any capacitance meter that can operate over the 0,15 MHz to 30 MHz frequency range. The capacitance is measured between the cable attached to the EUT port being assessed (all wires in the cable are connected together at the connection point to the meter) and the RGP. The same type of cable used in the conducted emissions measurement should be used for this capacitance measurement.NOTE This procedure has the lowest uncertainty if the length of cable between the EUT and AE is less than 1,25 m. Significantly longer cables are subject to standing waves that can adversely affect voltage and current measurements. For long cables where both the voltage and current limits cannot be met, changes to the measurement configuration can be implemented.", "G.2.4 Combination of current and voltage limitIf the common mode impedance is not 150 \u2126, the measurement of the voltage or the current alone is not acceptable because of a very high measurement uncertainty due to the undefined and unknown common mode impedances. If however both voltage and current are measured with current and voltage limits applied simultaneously, the result is a worst case estimation of the emission as explained below. The basic circuit for which the limit is defined is shown in Figure G.12.This circuit is the reference for which current and voltage limits are derived. Any other measurement has to be compared to this basic circuit. Z1 is an unknown parameter of the EUT. Z2 is 150 \u2126 in the reference measurement.\u2013 86 \u2013 CISPR 32:2015 \uf6d9 IEC 2015EUTZ1I Reference measurement with Z2 = 150 \u2126U0                                    U                                  Z2IEC", "Figure G.12 \u2013 Basic circuit for considering the limits with defined common mode impedance of 150 \u2126If the measurement is performed without defining the common mode impedance seen by the EUT, the simplified circuit is as shown in Figure G.12, where the common mode impedance Z2 seen by the EUT is defined by the AE and can have any value. Therefore Z1 as well as Z2 are unknown parameters of the measurement.EUT                                                              AEIZ1U0                                    U                                  Z2IEC", "Figure G.13 \u2013 Basic circuit for the measurement with unknown common mode impedanceIf the measurement is performed according to the circuit of Figure G.12 the limit of current and the limit of voltage are equivalent. The relation between current and voltage are always 150 \u2126 and either of the two can be used to determine the compliance with the limit. This is not the case if Z2 is not 150 \u2126. See Figure G.13.It is important to be aware that the source voltage U0 is not the only quantity determining the compliance with the limit. The disturbance voltage has to be measured at a standardized Z2 of 150 \u2126, while U in Figure G.13 depends on Z1, Z2, and U0 together. The limit value can be reached with an EUT containing a high impedance Z1 and a high source voltage U0, or with a lower U0 combined with a lower impedance Z1.In the more general case of Figure G.13 where Z2 is not defined, it is not possible to measure the exact value of the interference voltage. Since Z1 and U0 are not known, it is not possible to derive the interference voltage, even if the value of Z2 is known (or is measured or calculated from I and U). If for example an EUT, having excessive emissions, is measuredonly by determining the voltage in an arrangement with low Z2 (Z2  <150 \u2126) at the AE side, then the EUT might seem to comply with the limits. By contrast, if the same EUT is measured only by measuring the current in a measurement set-up with high Z2, (for example by addingferrites) the EUT might again seem to comply with the limits.CISPR 32:2015 \uf6d9 IEC 2015 \u2013 87 \u2013However, it can be shown that, if the current limit and the voltage limit are applied simultaneously, an EUT with emissions exceeding the limits is always discovered by exceeding either the current limit (if Z2 is <150 \u2126) or the voltage limit (if Z2 is >150 \u2126).If the common mode impedance of the AE (Z2) is far from 150 \u2126, it is possible that an EUT, which would comply with the limits if measured with Z2 = 150 \u2126, may be rejected. However an EUT not complying with the limits will never be accepted. The measurement according toC.4.1.6.4 is therefore a worst case estimation of the emission. If an EUT exceeds the limit with this procedure, it is possible the EUT would comply with the limits if it could be measuredwith Z2 = 150 \u2126. If emission measurements of the EUT by this procedure were compared to a power limit derived from the voltage and current limits, a more accurate measure of theinterference potential into 150 \u2126 is possible.", "G.2.5 Ferrite requirements for use in C.4.1.1Subclause C.4.1.6.3 defines  a measurement set-up for measuring the  common mode conducted emissions on the shield of a shielded cable. A 150 \u2126 load is specified to be connected between the cable shield and the RGP as described in C.4.1.6.3. Ferrites are shown placed over the cable shield between the 150 \u2126 load and the AE.

The ferrites are specified in C.4.1.6.3 to provide a high impedance such that \u201c\u2026the common mode impedance towards the right of the 150 \u2126 resistor shall be sufficiently large as to not affect the measurement.\u201d This impedance is shown in Figure G.14 as Zferrite in series withZaecm.The above quotation from C.4.1.6.3 infers that the combined series impedance of Zferrite andZaecm should not load down the 150 \u2126 resistor. The general approach in this standard for\u2013 88 \u2013 CISPR 32:2015 \uf6d9 IEC 2015tolerance on 150 \u2126 common mode loads is \u00b1 20 \u2126 over the frequency range of 0,15 MHz to 30 MHz. Combining these two concepts, the combined series impedance of Zferrite and Zaecm in parallel with the 150 \u2126 resistor (Z in Figure G.14) should be no lower than 130 \u2126. This in turn implies that this relationship should hold regardless of the value of Zaecm.This clause provides guidance on the use of ferrites in cause C.4.1.1.To establish the impedance characteristics of the ferrites, only two cases need to be considered: Zaecm = open circuit and Zaecm = short circuit. If the ferrites can be selected to satisfy these requirements, any value of Zaecm will be acceptable.\u2022 Case 1: Zaecm = open circuitThe combined series impedance of Zferrite and Zaecm is also an open circuit. An open circuit in parallel with the 150 \u2126 load is 150 \u2126. Zferrite can be of any value.\u2022 Case 2: Zaecm = short circuitThe combined series impedance of Zferrite and Zaecm is equal to Zferrite. The value of Zferrite in parallel with the 150 \u2126 resistor will then need to be no lower than 130 \u2126. In equation form:[(150)(Zferrite)]/(150 + Zferrite) \u2265 130  \u2126Solving for Zferrite yields a value of 975 \u2126.  This implies that the ferrites selected for this application should have a minimum impedance of 975 \u2126 over the frequency range of0,15 MHz to 30 MHz. For a given set of ferrites, the minimum impedance (j\u03c9L) will occur at the minimum frequency of 0,15 MHz.Combining the two cases cited above, it is seen that Case 2 at 0,15 MHz sets the minimum requirements for the impedance of ferrites so this value (or greater) would be acceptable.To determine whether  the selected ferrites will  accomplish the intended  function, the measurement set-up shown in Figure G.15 is suggested. A traditional impedance meter or analyser can be used to measure the impedance between point Z and the reference ground. Another approach is to measure the individual voltage and current at point Z (I and V in Figure G.15) and calculate the impedance. As a minimum, the impedance measurement should be made at 0,15 MHz. It would be advisable, however, to measure the impedance across the entire 0,15 MHz to 30 MHz range to ensure that no stray capacitance associated with the ferrites and the shielded cable degrades the ferrite impedance. This is of concern since laboratory data have shown that it is unlikely that desired impedance can be achieved with a single pass of the shielded cable through the ferrites. Multiple passes through the ferrites are necessary. This increases chances of stray capacitance adversely affecting the impedance of the ferrites. The capability to achieve the desired impedance versus frequency has been demonstrated in the laboratory.CISPR 32:2015 \uf6d9 IEC 2015 \u2013 89 \u2013Impedance meterCurrent probeCapacitive voltage probeFerritesI ZV150 \u2126Ref.

These limits have the same purpose as the emission limits for other MME given in Annex A.\u2022 The limits given in table clause A7.3 or A7.4 prevent interference to the uplink channel of a satellite transponder due to the totality of the LO frequencies emissions from the many outdoor units directed towards that satellite.The LO emissions are amplified by the gain of the outdoor parabolic antenna. Therefore, in the direction of the satellite (to which the parabolic  antenna is aligned), a relatively low emission limit of 37 dB(mV/m) is specified for the LNB (see Table H.1).The emission power limit in table clause A7.4 is calculated for an outdoor unit without a feed horn. Hence, if the feed horn cannot be separated from the outdoor unit, this measurement result shall be compensated by subtracting the value of the gain of the feed horn.\u00a0Table H.1 \u2013 Derivation of the limit within \u00b1 7\u00b0 of the main beam axis", "Table H.1 \u2013 Derivation of the limit within \u00b1 7\u00b0 of the main beam axisFactors used to calculate the limitCalculated valueBased element is thermal noise (room temperature), -173 dBm/Hz-113 dBm/MHzRequested noise margin at the uplink receiver of the satellite-10 dBAllowed disturbance power at satellite receiver input-123 dBmSatellite receiving antenna gain34 dBiAllowed total disturbance power at satellite position.-157 dBmThe number of LNBs directed at the satellite (50 000 000 is assumed, and 10 \u00d7 LOG (50 000 000) = 77)77 dBAllowed disturbance power at satellite point emitted from one receiver.-234 dBmPropagation loss for 40 000 km distance-207 dBAllowed total disturbance power at LNB position-27 dBmTypical gain overall antenna of the home satellite receivers33 dBiAllowed disturbance power-60 dBmAllowed disturbance power (unit change from dBm to dBpW)30 dBpWCalculated radiated field strength limit from outdoor unit of home satellite receivers (half wave dipole, 3 m distance)37 dBmV/mH.2 GeneralThis annex supplements the general guidance and requirements of this standard.CISPR 32:2015 \uf6d9 IEC 2015 \u2013 91 \u2013Where possible, the outdoor unit (LNB) shall be measured without the parabolic reflector. The feed horn shall be attached to the LNB, except in the case of direct power measurement of the LO. In the majority of cases the LNB and feed horn cannot be separated. If the EUT is provided without a feed horn, then a typical feed horn shall be used for the measurement.The limit for the measurement within \u00b17\u00b0 of the main beam axis is for the LO terminal power. The limit shall be relaxed by the gain of the feed horn. The gain is specified at the centre frequency of the receiver band. If the gain of the feed horn is not specified, a standard value of 10 dBi shall be applied.In the rare case of a non-detachable parabolic reflector, the reflector\u2019s gain shall be also added to the limit (or subtracted from the measurement result) for the measurement of the LO emission within \u00b17\u00b0 of the main beam axis (limit in table clause A7.3).", "H.3 Operation conditionsFor the measurement of the LO leakage, the EUT shall be connected to the power supply (via a suitable bias tee) and control signals for switching the LO frequencies, if applicable.For the measurement of spurious radiated emissions, the EUT needs an input signal which can be an un-modulated carrier. Therefore a suitable small transmit antenna shall be placed within the main beam axis of the EUT. The influence of the transmit antenna on the measurement result shall be reduced to a minimum. An example arrangement of the transmit antenna is shown in Figure H.2.The input signal shall be adjusted to get the maximum rated output level from the EUT. For the measurement in the frequency range from 30 MHz to 1 GHz the input signal shall be adjusted so that the output frequency is within this frequency range. For the measurement in the frequency range above 1 GHz, the frequency of the input signal shall be adjusted in such a way that the EUT is measured, as a minimum, at the lowest, middle and highest rated output frequency within the measured frequency range. A typical scenario is as follows:For an LNB with the following characteristics:\u2013 maximum output level: \u201310 dBm,\u2013 LO frequencies: 9,75 GHz and 10,6 GHz,\u2013 output frequency ranges950 MHz to 1 950 MHz (for 9,75 GHz LO)1 100 MHz to 2 150 MHz (for 10,6 GHz LO)the following output frequencies shall be measured with the EUT set to output level of \u2013 10 dBm.\u2013 LO frequency 9,75 GHz: 950 MHz, 1 450 MHz and 1 950 MHz\u2013 LO frequency 10,6 GHz: 1 100 MHz, 1 625 MHz and 2 150 MHz", "H.4 Specific requirements for LO measurementIn the case of a detachable feed horn, the radiated emission of the LO leakage within \u00b17\u00b0 of the main beam axis can be measured directly by a power measurement at the feed horn interface. If a suitable interface (typically types R120, C120) is available, a power meter or spectrum analyzer can be connected to the LNB via a suitable adapter. Due allowance shall be made for the feed losses between the available interface and the antenna flange.\u2013 92 \u2013 CISPR 32:2015 \uf6d9 IEC 2015", "H.5 EUT arrangementsFor the arrangement of the EUT the requirements of Annex D shall be satisfied.

At this date, the publication will bereconfirmed,withdrawn,replaced by a revised edition, oramended.NOTE 3 The attention of National Committees is drawn to the fact that equipment manufacturers and testing organizations may need a transitional period following publication of a new, amended or revised IEC publication in which to make products in accordance with the new requirements and to equip themselves for conducting new or revised tests.It is the recommendation of the committee that the content of this publication be adopted for implementation nationally not earlier than 12 months or later than 36 months from the date of publication.60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010 \u2013 7 \u2013The following differences exist in the countries indicated below.Introduction: The Part 1 standard (UL60335-1) is only used in combination with a part 2 (UL60335-2-x).National differences are specified in these standards (USA).5.7: The ambient temperature is 25 \u00b0C \u00b1 10 \u00b0C (Japan).5.7: The ambient temperature is 27 \u00b0C \u00b1 5 \u00b0C (India).6.1: Class 0 appliances and class 0I appliances are not allowed (Australia, Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, India, Israel, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Singapore, Slovakia, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom).7.12.2: The requirements for full disconnection do not apply (Japan).13.2: The test circuit and some leakage current limits are different (India).22.2: The second paragraph of this subclause dealing with single-phase class I appliances with heating elements cannot be complied with because of the supply system (France and Norway).22.2: Double-pole switches or protective devices are required (Norway).22.35 Accessible metal parts separated from live parts by earthed metal parts are not regarded as likely to become live in the event of an insulation fault (USA).24.1: IEC component standard requirements are replaced by the relevant requirements of component standards specified in UL60335-1 and parts 2 (UL60335-2-x) (USA).25.3: A set of supply leads is not permitted (Norway, Denmark, Finland, Netherlands).25.8: 0,5 mm2 supply cords are not allowed for class I appliances (Australia and New Zealand).26.6: Conductor cross-sectional areas are different (USA).29.1: Different rated impulse voltages are used between 50 V and 150 V (Japan).\u2013 8 \u2013 60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010INTRODUCTIONIt has been assumed in the drafting of this International Standard that the execution of its provisions is entrusted to appropriately qualified and experienced persons.This standard recognizes the internationally accepted level of protection against hazards such as electrical, mechanical, thermal, fire and radiation of appliances when operated as in normal use taking into account the manufacturer's instructions. It also covers abnormal situations that  can  be expected  in practice  and takes  into account  the way in which electromagnetic phenomena can affect the safe operation of appliances.This standard takes into account the requirements of IEC 60364 as far as possible so that there is compatibility with the wiring rules when the appliance is connected to the supply mains. However, national wiring rules may differ.If the functions of an appliance are covered by different parts 2 of IEC 60335, the relevant part 2 is applied to each function separately, as far as is reasonable. If applicable, the influence of one function on the other is taken into account.NOTE 1 Throughout this publication, when \u201cPart 2\u201d is mentioned, it refers to the relevant part of IEC 60335.When a part 2 standard does not include additional requirements to cover hazards dealt with in Part 1, Part 1 applies.NOTE 2 This means that the technical committees responsible for the part 2 standards have determined that it is not necessary to specify particular requirements for the appliance in question over and above the general requirements.This standard is a product family standard dealing with the safety of appliances and takes precedence over horizontal and generic standards covering the same subject.NOTE 3 Horizontal and generic standards covering a hazard are not applicable since they have been taken into consideration when developing the general and particular requirements for the IEC 60335 series of standards. For example, in the case of temperature requirements for surfaces on many appliances, generic standards, such as ISO 13732-1 for hot surfaces, are not applicable in addition to Part 1 or part 2 standards.Individual countries may wish to consider the application of the standard, as far as is reasonable, to appliances not mentioned in a part 2, and to appliances designed on new principles.An appliance that complies with the text of this standard will not necessarily be considered to comply with the safety principles of the standard if, when examined and tested, it is found to have other features which impair the level of safety covered by these requirements.An appliance employing materials or having forms of construction differing from those detailed in the requirements of this standard may be examined and tested according to the intent of the requirements and, if found to be substantially equivalent, may be considered to comply with the standard.NOTE 4 Standards dealing with non-safety aspects of household appliances areIEC standards published by TC 59 concerning methods of measuring performance;CISPR 11, CISPR 14-1, IEC 61000-3-2 and IEC 61000-3-3 concerning electromagnetic emissions;CISPR 14-2 concerning electromagnetic immunity;IEC standards published by TC 111 concerning environmental matters.60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010 \u2013 9 \u2013HOUSEHOLD AND SIMILAR ELECTRICAL APPLIANCES \u2013 SAFETY  \u2013Part 1: General requirementsScopeThis International Standard deals with the safety of electrical appliances for household and similar purposes, their rated voltage being not more than 250 V for single-phase appliances and 480 V for other appliances.NOTE 1 Battery-operated appliances and other d.c. supplied appliances are within the scope of this standard.Appliances not intended for normal household use but which nevertheless may be a source of danger to the public, such as appliances intended to be used by laymen in shops, in light industry and on farms, are within the scope of this standard.NOTE 2 Examples of such appliances are catering equipment, cleaning appliances for commercial use, and appliances for hairdressers.As far as is practicable, this standard  deals  with the  common hazards  presented by appliances that are encountered by all persons in and around the home. However, in general, it does not take into accountpersons (including children) whosephysical, sensory or mental capabilities; orlack of experience and knowledgeprevents them from using the appliance safely without supervision or instruction;children playing with the appliance.NOTE 3 Attention is drawn to the fact thatfor appliances intended to be used in vehicles or on board ships or aircraft, additional requirements may be necessary;in many countries, additional requirements are specified by the national health authorities, the national authorities responsible for the protection of labour, the national water supply authorities and similar authorities.NOTE 4 This standard does not apply toappliances intended exclusively for industrial purposes;appliances intended to be used in locations where special conditions prevail, such as the presence of a corrosive or explosive atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas);audio, video and similar electronic apparatus (IEC 60065);appliances for medical purposes (IEC 60601);hand-held motor-operated electric tools (IEC 60745);personal computers and similar equipment (IEC 60950-1);transportable motor-operated electric tools (IEC 61029).Normative referencesThe following referenced documents are indispensable for the application of this document.

However, the tests of Clauses 20, 22 (except 22.10, 22.11 and 22.18) to 26, 28, 30 and 31 may be carried out on separate appliances. The test of 22.3 is carried out on a new appliance.NOTE 1 Additional samples may be required if the appliance has to be tested under different conditions, for example if it can be supplied with different voltages.If an intentionally weak part becomes open circuit during the tests of Clause 19, an additional appliance may be needed.The testing of components may require the submission of additional samples of these components. If the test of Annex C has to be carried out, six samples of the motor are needed.If the test of Annex D has to be carried out, an additional appliance may be used. If the tests of Annex G are carried out, four additional transformers are needed.If the tests of Annex H are carried out, three switches or three additional appliances are needed.NOTE 2 The cumulative stress resulting from successive tests on electronic circuits is to be avoided. It may be necessary to replace components or to use additional samples. The number of additional samples should be kept to a minimum by an evaluation of the relevant electronic circuits.NOTE 3 If an appliance has to be dismantled in order to carry out a test, care is to be taken to ensure that it is reassembled as originally supplied. In case of doubt, subsequent tests may be carried out on a separate sample.The tests are carried out in the order of the clauses. However, the test of 22.11 on the appliance at room temperature is carried out before the tests of Clause 8. The tests of Clause 14 and 21.2 and 22.24 are carried out after the tests of Clause 29. The test of 19.14 is carried out before the tests of 19.11.If it is evident from the construction of the appliance that a particular test is not applicable, the test is not carried out.When testing appliances that are also supplied by other energies such as gas, the influence of their consumption has to be taken into account.The tests are carried out with the appliance or any movable part of it placed in the most unfavourable position that may occur in normal use.Appliances provided with controls or switching devices are tested with these controls or devices adjusted to their most unfavourable setting, if the setting can be altered by the user.NOTE 1 If the adjusting means of the control is accessible without the aid of a tool, this subclause applies whether the setting can be altered by hand or with the aid of a tool. If the adjusting means is not accessible without the aid of a tool and if the setting is not intended to be altered by the user, this subclause does not apply.NOTE 2 Adequate sealing is regarded as preventing alteration of the setting by the user.\u2013 22 \u2013 60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010For appliances fitted with a voltage selector switch, unless otherwise specified, the tests are carried out with the switch in the position corresponding to the rated voltage value used for the tests.The tests are carried out in a draught-free location at an ambient temperature of 20 \u00b0C \u00b1 5 \u00b0C.If the temperature attained by any part is limited by a temperature sensitive device or is influenced by the temperature at which a change of state occurs, for example when water boils, the ambient temperature is maintained at 23 \u00b0C \u00b1 2 \u00b0C in case of doubt.Test conditions relating to frequency and voltageAppliances for a.c. only are tested with a.c. at rated frequency, and those for a.c. andd.c. are tested at the more unfavourable supply.Appliances for a.c. that are not marked with rated frequency or are marked with a rated frequency range of 50 Hz to 60 Hz are tested with either 50 Hz or 60 Hz, whichever is the more unfavourable.Appliances having more than one rated voltage are tested on the basis of the most unfavourable voltage.For motor-operated appliances, and combined appliances, marked with a rated voltage range, when it is specified that the supply voltage is equal to the rated voltage multiplied by a factor, the appliance is supplied atthe upper limit of the rated voltage range multiplied by this factor, if greater than 1;the lower limit of the rated voltage range multiplied by this factor, if smaller than 1.When a factor is not specified, the supply voltage is the most unfavourable within the rated voltage range.NOTE 1 If a heating appliance has a rated voltage range, the upper limit of the voltage range will usually be the most unfavourable voltage within the range.NOTE 2 For motor-operated appliances, combined appliances and appliances having more than one rated voltage or rated voltage range, it may be necessary to make some of the tests at the minimum, the mean and the maximum values of the rated voltage or the rated voltage range in order to establish the most unfavourable voltage.For heating appliances, and combined appliances, marked with a rated power input range, when it is specified that the power input is equal to the rated power input multiplied by a factor, the appliance is operated atthe upper limit of the rated power input range multiplied by this factor, if greater than 1;the lower limit of the rated power input range multiplied by this factor, if smaller than 1.When a factor is not specified, the power input is the most unfavourable within the rated power input range.For appliances  marked with  a rated voltage  range  and rated  power input corresponding to the mean of the rated voltage range, when it is specified that the power input is equal to rated power input multiplied by a factor, the appliance is operated atthe calculated power input corresponding to the upper limit of the rated voltage rangemultiplied by this factor, if greater than 1;60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010 \u2013 23 \u2013the calculated power input corresponding to the lower limit of the rated voltage rangemultiplied by this factor, if smaller than 1.When a factor is not specified, the power input corresponds to the power input at the most unfavourable voltage within the rated voltage range.When alternative heating elements or accessories are made available by the appliance manufacturer, the appliance is tested with those elements or accessories which give the most unfavourable results.The tests are carried out on the  appliance as supplied. However,  an appliance constructed as a single appliance but supplied in a number of units is tested after assembly in accordance with the instructions provided with the appliance.Built-in appliances and fixed appliances are installed in accordance with the instructions provided with the appliance before testing.Appliances intended to be connected to fixed wiring by means of a flexible cord are tested with the appropriate flexible cord connected to the appliance.For heating appliances and combined appliances, when it is specified that the appliance has to operate at a power input multiplied by a factor, this applies only to heating elements without appreciable positive temperature coefficient of resistance.For heating elements with appreciable positive temperature coefficient of resistance, other than PTC heating elements, the supply voltage is determined by supplying the appliance at rated voltage until the heating element reaches its operating temperature. The supply voltage is then rapidly increased to the value necessary to give the power input required for the relevant test, this value of the supply voltage being maintained throughout the test.NOTE In general, the temperature coefficient is considered to be appreciable if, at rated voltage, the power input of the appliance in cold condition differs by more than 25 % from the power input at operating temperature.The tests for appliances with PTC heating elements and for heating appliances and combined appliances where the heating elements are supplied via a switch mode power supply are carried out at a voltage corresponding to the specified power input.When a power input greater than the rated power input is specified, the factor for multiplying the voltage is equal to the square root of the factor for multiplying the power input.If class 0I appliances or class I appliances have accessible metal parts that are not earthed and are not separated from live parts by an intermediate metal part that is earthed, such parts are checked for compliance with the appropriate requirements specified for class II construction.If class 0I appliances or class I appliances have accessible non-metallic parts, such parts are checked for compliance with the appropriate requirements specified for class II construction unless these parts are separated from live parts by an intermediate metal part that is earthed.NOTE Guidance is given in Annex P for enhanced requirements that may be used to ensure an acceptable level of protection against electrical and thermal hazards for particular types of appliances used in an installation without a protective earthing conductor in countries that have warm damp equable climates.If appliances have parts operating at safety extra-low voltage, such parts are checked for compliance with the appropriate requirements specified for class III construction.\u2013 24 \u2013 60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010When testing electronic circuits, the supply is to be free from perturbations from external sources that can influence the results of the tests.Appliances powered by rechargeable batteries are tested in accordance with Annex B.If linear and angular dimensions are specified without a tolerance, ISO 2768-1 is applicable.If a component or part of the appliance has both a self resetting feature and a non- self-resetting feature and if the non-self-resetting feature is not required in order to comply with the standard, then appliances incorporating such a component or part shall be tested with the non-self-resetting feature rendered inoperative.", "Appliances shall be of one of the following classes with respect to protection against electric shock:class 0, class 0I, class I, class II, class III.Compliance is checked by inspection and by the relevant tests.Appliances shall have the appropriate degree of protection against harmful ingress of water.Compliance is checked by inspection and by the relevant tests.NOTE The degrees of protection against harmful ingress of water are given in IEC 60529.", "Appliances shall be marked with therated voltage or rated voltage range in volts;symbol for nature of supply, unless the rated frequency is marked;rated power input in watts or rated current in amperes;name, trade mark or identification mark of the manufacturer or responsible vendor;model or type reference;symbol IEC 60417-5172 (2003-02) for class II appliances only;IP number according to degree of protection against ingress of water, other than IPX0;symbol IEC 60417-5180 (2003-02), for class  III appliances. This marking  is not necessary for appliances that are operated only by batteries  (primary batteries  or secondary batteries that are recharged outside of the appliance).NOTE 1 The first numeral of the IP number need not be marked on the appliance.NOTE 2 Additional markings are allowed provided they do not give rise to misunderstanding.NOTE 3 If components are marked separately, the marking of the appliance and that of the components is to be such that there can be no doubt with regard to the marking of the appliance itself.NOTE 4 If the appliance is marked with rated pressure, the units used may be bars but only together with pascals and placed in brackets.60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010 \u2013 25 \u2013The enclosure of electrically-operated water valves incorporated in external hose-sets for connection of an appliance to the water mains shall be marked with symbol IEC 60417-5036 (2002-10) if their working voltage exceeds extra-low voltage.Compliance is checked by inspection.Stationary appliances for multiple supply shall be marked with the substance of the following:Warning: Before obtaining access to terminals, all supply circuits must be disconnected.This warning shall be placed in the vicinity of the terminal cover.Compliance is checked by inspection.Appliances having  a range  of rated  values  and which can be operated without adjustment throughout the range shall be marked with the lower and upper limits of the range separated by a hyphen.NOTE 1 Example: 115-230 V: The appliance is suitable for any value within the marked range (a curling iron with a PTC heating element or an appliance incorporating an input switch mode power supply).Appliances having different rated values and which have to be adjusted for use at a particular value by the user or installer shall be marked with the different values separated by an oblique stroke.NOTE 2 Example: 115/230 V: The appliance is only suitable for the marked values (a shaver with a selector switch).NOTE 3 This requirement is also applicable to appliances with provision for connection to both single-phase and multi-phase supplies.Example: 230 V/400 V: The appliance is only suitable for the voltage values indicated, 230 V being for single- phase operation and 400 V for three-phase operation (a dishwasher with terminals for both supplies).Compliance is checked by inspection.If the appliance can be adjusted for different rated voltages, the voltage to which the appliance is adjusted shall be clearly discernible. If frequent changes in voltage setting are not required, this requirement is considered to  be met if the rated voltage to which the appliance is to be adjusted can be determined from a wiring diagram fixed to the appliance.NOTE The wiring diagram may be on the inside of a cover that has to be removed to connect the supply conductors. It is not to be on a label loosely attached to the appliance.Compliance is checked by inspection.For appliances marked with more than one rated voltage or with one or more rated voltage ranges, the rated power input or rated current for each of these voltages or ranges shall be marked. However, if the difference between the limits of a rated voltage range does not exceed 10 % of the arithmetic mean value of the range, the marking for rated power input or rated current may be related to the arithmetic mean value of the range.The upper and lower limits of the rated power input or rated current shall be marked on the appliance so that the relation between input and voltage is clear.Compliance is checked by inspection.When symbols are used, they shall be as follows\u2013 26 \u2013 60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010[symbol IEC 60417- 5031(2002-10)]direct current[symbol IEC 60417- 5032(2002-10)]alternating current3                [symbol IEC 60417- 5032-1(2002-10)]three-phase alternating current3N            [symbol IEC 60417- 5032-2(2002-10)]three-phase alternating current with neutral[symbol IEC 60417- 5016(2002-10)]fuse-linkNOTE 1 The rated current of the fuse link may be indicated in association with this symbol.time-lag miniature fuse-link  where X is the symbol  for the time/current characteristic as given in IEC 60127[symbol IEC 60417- 5019(2006-08)][symbol IEC 60417- 5018(2006-10)][symbol IEC 60417- 5172(2003-02)][symbol IEC 60417- 5012(2002-10)]protective earthfunctional earthingclass II equipmentlampNOTE 2 The rated wattage of the lamp may be indicated in association with this symbol.[symbol ISO 7000-0434(2004-01)]caution[symbol ISO 7000-0790(2004-01)]read operator's manual[symbol IEC 60417- 5021(2002-10)]equipotentiality[symbol IEC 60417-5036(2002-10)]dangerous voltage[symbol IEC 60417-5180(2003-02)]Class III applianceThe symbol for nature of supply shall be placed next to the marking for rated voltage.60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010 \u2013 27 \u2013The symbol for class II appliances shall be placed so that it will be obvious that it is a part of the technical information and is unlikely to be confused with any other marking.Units of physical quantities and their symbols shall be those of the international standardized system.NOTE 3 Additional symbols are allowed provided that they do not give rise to misunderstanding.

The temperature rise of the cord sheath is determined as near as possible to the hub of the reel and also between the two outermost layers of the cord on the reel.For cord  storage devices, other  than  automatic cord  reels,  which  are intended to accommodate the supply cord partially while the appliance is in operation, 50 cm of the cord is unwound. The temperature rise of the stored part of the cord is determined at the most unfavourable place.Temperature rises, other than those of windings, are determined by means of fine-wire thermocouples positioned so that they have minimum effect on the temperature of the part under test.NOTE 1 Thermocouples having wires with a diameter not exceeding 0,3 mm are considered to be fine-wire thermocouples.Thermocouples used for determining the temperature rise of the surface of walls, ceiling and floor of the test corner are attached to the back of small blackened disks of copper or brass, 15 mm in diameter and 1 mm thick. The front of the disk is flush with the surface of the board.As far as is possible, the appliance is positioned so that the thermocouples detect the highest temperatures.The temperature rise of electrical insulation, other than that of windings, is determined on the surface of the insulation at places where failure could causea short circuit;contact between live parts and accessible metal parts;bridging of insulation;a reduction of clearances  or creepage distances below the values  specified in Clause 29.NOTE 2 If it is necessary to dismantle the appliance to position thermocouples, care has to be taken to ensure that the appliance has been correctly reassembled. In case of doubt, the power input is remeasured.NOTE 3 The point of separation of the cores of a multicore cord and the point where insulated wires enter lampholders are examples of places where thermocouples are positioned.Temperature rises of windings are determined by the resistance method unless the windings are  non-uniform or if it is difficult to make the necessary connections, in which case the temperature rise is determined by means of thermocouples. At the beginning of the test, the windings are to be at room temperature.\u2013 36 \u2013 60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010The temperature rise of a winding is calculated from the formula:\u0394t =R2 \u2212 R1 R1(k + t1) \u2013 (t2 \u2013 t1)where\u0394t is the temperature rise of the winding;R1 is the resistance at the beginning of the test; R2 is the resistance at the end of the test;k is equal to225 for aluminium windings and copper/aluminium windings with an aluminium content\u2265 85 %,229,75 for copper/aluminium windings with an copper content > 15 % to < 85 %,234,5 for copper windings and copper/aluminium windings with an copper content\u2265 85 %;t1 is the room temperature at the beginning of the test; t2 is the room temperature at the end of the test.NOTE 4 It is recommended that the resistance of windings at the end of the test be determined by taking resistance measurements as soon as possible after switching off and then at short intervals so that a curve of resistance against time can be plotted for ascertaining the resistance at the instant of switching off.Heating appliances are operated under normal operation and at 1,15 times rated power input.Motor-operated appliances are operated under normal operation and supplied with the most unfavourable voltage between 0,94 times and 1,06 times the rated voltage.Combined appliances are operated under normal operation and supplied with the most unfavourable voltage between 0,94 times and 1,06 times the rated voltage.The appliance is operated for a duration corresponding to the most unfavourable conditions of normal use.NOTE The duration of the test may consist of more than one cycle of operation.During the test, the temperature rises are monitored continuously and shall not exceed the values shown in Table 3. The temperature rise limit for metal applies to parts having a metal coating at least 0,1 mm thick and to metal parts having a plastic coating less than 0,3 mm thick.If the temperature rise of the motor winding exceeds the value specified in Table 3 or if there is doubt with regard to the temperature classification of the insulation of the motor, the tests of Annex C are carried out.Protective devices shall not operate and sealing compound shall not flow out.

However, the temperature rise values specified are based on 25 \u00b0C.NOTE 3 The temperature of the terminals of switches is measured if the switch is tested in accordance with Annex H.a To allow for the fact that the average temperature of windings of universal motors, relays, solenoids and similar components is usually above the temperature at the points on the windings where thermocouples are placed, the figures without parentheses apply when the resistance method is used and those within parentheses apply when thermocouples are used. For windings of vibrator coils and a.c. motors, the figures without parentheses apply in both cases.The temperature rise limit of windings in transformers and inductors mounted on printed circuit boards is equal to the thermal class of the winding insulation reduced by 25 K provided the largest dimension of the winding does not exceed 5 mm in cross section or length.For motors constructed so that the circulation of air between the inside and the outside of the case is prevented but which are not necessarily sufficiently enclosed to be considered airtight, the temperature rise limits may be increased by 5 K.b T means the maximum ambient temperature in which the component or its switch head can operate.The ambient is the temperature of the air at the hottest point at a distance of 5 mm from the surface of the component concerned. However, if a thermostat or a temperature limiter is mounted on a heat-conducting part, the declared temperature limit of the mounting surface (Ts) is also applicable. Therefore, the temperature rise of the mounting surface has to be measured.The temperature rise limit does not apply to switches or controls tested in accordance with the conditions occurring in the appliance.c This limit may be exceeded if the instruction specified in 7.12.3 is supplied.d Locations for measuring the temperature rises are specified in Table 12.1 of IEC 60598-1.e The values in parentheses apply to locations where the part is fixed to a hot surface.f There is no specific limit for thermoplastic material. However, the temperature rise has to be determined in order that the tests of 30.1 can be carried out.g The limit specified concerns the deterioration of wood and it does not take into account deterioration of surface finishes.h There is no limit for the temperature rise of capacitors that are short-circuited in 19.11.i Temperature marking for capacitors mounted on printed circuit boards may be given in the technical sheet.j IEC 60245 Types 53 and 57 supply cords have a T rating of 60 \u00b0C; IEC 60245 Type 88 supply cords have a T rating of 70 \u00b0C;IEC 60227 Types 52 and 53 supply cords have a T rating of 70 \u00b0C; IEC 60227 Types 56 and 57 supply cords have a T rating of 90 \u00b0C.", "At operating temperature, the leakage current of the appliance shall not be excessive and its electric strength shall be adequate.Compliance is checked by the tests of 13.2 and 13.3.The appliance is operated under normal operation for the duration specified in 11.7.Heating appliances are operated at 1,15 times the rated power input.\u2013 40 \u2013 60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010Motor-operated appliances and combined appliances are supplied at 1,06 times rated voltage.Three-phase appliances, which according to the instructions for installation are also suitable for single-phase supply, are tested as single-phase appliances with the three circuits connected in parallel.Protective impedance and radio interference filters are disconnected before carrying out the tests.For class 0 appliances, class II appliances and class III appliances, the leakage current is measured by means of the circuit described in Figure 4 of IEC 60990. For other appliances, a low impedance ammeter capable of measuring the true r.m.s. value of  the leakage current may be used.The leakage current is measured between any pole of the supply and accessible metal parts connected to metal foil having an area not exceeding 20 cm \u00d7 10 cm which is in contact with accessible surfaces of insulating materials.The metal foil has the largest area possible on the surface under test without exceeding the dimensions specified. If its area is smaller than the surface under test, it is moved to test all parts of the surface. The heat dissipation of the appliance is not to be affected by the metal foil.For single-phase appliances, the measuring circuit is shown in the following figures:if of class II, Figure 1;if other than class II, Figure 2.The leakage current is measured with the selector switch in each of the positions a and b.For three-phase appliances, the measuring circuit is shown in the following figures:if of class II, Figure 3;if other than class II, Figure 4.For three-phase appliances, the leakage current is measured with the switches a, b and c in the closed position.

The protective device in the fixed wiring does not provide the necessary protection.\u2013 48 \u2013 60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010Unless otherwise specified, only one abnormal condition is simulated at any one time.If more than one of the tests are applicable to the same appliance, these tests are carried out consecutively after the appliance has cooled down to room temperature.For combined appliances, the tests are carried out with motors and heating elements operating simultaneously under normal operation, the appropriate tests being applied one at a time to each motor and heating element.When it is stated that a control is short-circuited, it may be rendered inoperative instead.Unless otherwise specified, compliance with the tests of this clause is checked as described in 19.13.Appliances with heating  elements  are tested  under the conditions  specified  in Clause 11 but with restricted heat dissipation. The supply voltage, determined prior to the test, is that required to provide a power input of 0,85 times rated power input under normal operation when the power input has stabilized. This voltage is maintained throughout the test.NOTE Controls that operate during the test of Clause 11 are allowed to operate.The test of 19.2 is repeated but with a supply voltage, determined prior to the test, equal to that required to provide a power input of 1,24 times rated power input under normal operation when the power input has stabilized. This voltage is maintained throughout the test.NOTE Controls that operate during the test of Clause 11 are allowed to operate.The appliance is tested under the conditions specified in Clause 11. Any control that limits the temperature during the test of Clause 11 is short-circuited.If the appliance incorporates more than one control, they are short-circuited in turn.The test of 19.4 is repeated on class  0I appliances and class I appliances incorporating tubular sheathed or embedded heating elements. However, controls are not short-circuited but one end of the element is connected to the sheath of the heating element.This test is repeated with the polarity of the supply to the appliance reversed and with the other end of the element connected to the sheath.The test is not carried out on appliances intended to be permanently connected to fixed wiring and on appliances where an all-pole disconnection occurs during the test of 19.4.Appliances with a neutral are tested with the neutral connected to the sheath.NOTE For embedded heating elements, the metal enclosure is considered to be the sheath.Appliances with PTC heating elements are supplied at rated voltage until steady conditions with regard to power input and temperature are established.The working voltage of the PTC heating element is increased by 5 % and the appliance is operated until steady conditions are re-established. The voltage is then increased in similar steps until 1,5 times working voltage is reached, or until the PTC heating element ruptures, whichever occurs first.60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010 \u2013 49 \u2013The appliance is operated under stalled conditions bylocking the rotor of appliances for which the locked rotor torque is smaller than the full load torque;locking moving parts of other appliances.If an appliance has more than one motor, the test is carried out for each motor separately.Appliances incorporating motors and having capacitors in the circuit of an auxiliary winding, are operated with the rotor locked, the capacitors being open-circuited one at a time. The test is repeated with the capacitors short-circuited one at a time, unless they are of class P2 of IEC 60252-1.NOTE 1 This test is carried out with the rotor locked since some motors may start thus giving rise to inconsistent results.For each of the tests, appliances provided with a timer or programmer are supplied at rated voltage for a period equal to the maximum period allowed by the timer or programmer.Other appliances are supplied at rated voltage for a periodof 30 s forhand-held appliances,appliances that have to be kept switched on by hand or foot, andappliances that are continuously loaded by hand;of 5 min for other appliances that are operated while attended;until steady conditions are established, for other appliances.NOTE 2 Appliances that are tested for 5 min are indicated in the relevant part 2.During the test, the temperature of the windings shall not exceed the relevant value specified in Table 8.Table 8 \u2013 Maximum winding temperatureType of applianceTemperature\u00b0CClass 105 (A)Class 120 (E)Class 130 (B)Class 155 (F)Class 180 (H)Class 200 (N)Class 220 (R)Class 250Appliances other than those operated until steady conditions are established200215225240260280300330Appliances operated until steady conditions are established150165175190210230250280200215225240260280300330175190200215235255275305150165175190210230250280if impedance protectedif protected by a protective deviceduring the first hour, maximum valueafter the first hour, maximum valueafter the first hour, arithmetic averageOne phase of appliances incorporating multi-phase motors is disconnected. The appliance is then operated under normal operation and supplied at rated voltage for the period specified in 19.7.\u2013 50 \u2013 60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010A running overload test is carried out on appliances incorporating motors that are intended to be remotely or automatically controlled or liable to be operated continuously.Motor-operated appliances  and combined appliances for which  Subclause  30.2.3  is applicable and that use overload protective devices relying on electronic circuits to protect the motor windings, other than those that sense winding temperatures directly, are also subjected to the running overload test.The appliance is operated under normal operation and supplied at rated voltage until steady conditions are established. The load is then increased so that the current through the motor windings is raised by 10 % and the appliance is operated again until steady conditions are established, the supply voltage being maintained at its original value. The load is again increased and the test is repeated until the protective device operates or the motor stalls.During the test, the winding temperature shall not exceed140 \u00b0C, for class 105 (A) winding insulation;155 \u00b0C, for class 120 (E) winding insulation;165 \u00b0C, for class 130 (B) winding insulation;180 \u00b0C, for class 155 (F) winding insulation;200 \u00b0C, for class 180 (H) winding insulation;220 \u00b0C, for class 200 (N) winding insulation;240 \u00b0C, for class 220 (R) winding insulation;270 \u00b0C, for class 250 winding insulation.NOTE If the load cannot be increased in appropriate steps, the motor may be removed from the appliance and tested separately.Appliances incorporating series motors are operated with the lowest possible load and supplied at 1,3 times rated voltage for 1 min.During the test, parts shall not be ejected from the appliance.Electronic circuits are checked by evaluation of the fault conditions specified in19.11.2 for all circuits or parts of circuits, unless they comply with the conditions specified in 19.11.1.NOTE 1 In general, examination of the appliance and its circuit diagram will reveal the fault conditions which have to be simulated, so that testing can be limited to those cases that may be expected to give the most unfavourable results.Appliances incorporating an electronic circuit that relies upon a programmable component to function correctly are subjected to the test of 19.11.4.8, unless restarting at any point in the operating cycle after interruption of operation due to a supply voltage dip will not result in a hazard. The test is carried out after removal of all batteries and other components intended to maintain the programmable component supply voltage during mains supply voltage dips, interruptions and variations.Appliances having a device with an off position obtained by electronic disconnection, or a device that can place the appliance in a stand-by mode, are subjected to the tests of 19.11.4.NOTE 2 For information on general guidance relating to the sequence of tests for the evaluation of electronic circuits, reference should be made to Annex Q. It should be realized that in the Parts 2 there may be additional or alternative abnormal operation tests specified; these are not shown in the flow chart. For correct application of the standard, the normative text takes precedence over the guidance given in Annex Q.If the safety of the appliance under any of the fault conditions depends on the operation of a miniature fuse-link complying with IEC 60127, the test of 19.12 is carried out.60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010 \u2013 51 \u2013During and after each test, the temperature of windings shall not exceed the values specified in Table 8. However, these limits do not apply to fail-safe transformers complying with Subclause 15.5 of IEC 61558-1. The appliance shall comply with the conditions specified in19.13. Any current  flowing through protective impedance shall not exceed the limits specified in 8.1.4.NOTE 3 Unless it is necessary to replace components after any of the tests, the electric strength test required by19.13 need only be carried out after the final test on the electronic circuit.If a conductor of a printed circuit board becomes open-circuited, the appliance is considered to have withstood the particular test, provided both of the following conditions are met:the base material of the printed circuit board withstands the test of Annex E;any loosened conductor does not reduce clearances or creepage distances between live parts and accessible metal parts below the values specified in Clause 29.Fault conditions a) to g) specified in 19.11.2 are not applied to circuits or parts of circuits when both of the following conditions are met:the electronic circuit is a low-power circuit as described below;protection against electric shock, fire hazard, mechanical hazard or dangerous malfunction of other parts of the appliance does not rely on the correct functioning of the electronic circuit.An example of a low-power circuit is shown in Figure 6 and is determined as follows.The appliance is supplied at rated voltage and a variable resistor, adjusted to its maximum resistance, is connected between the point to be investigated and the opposite pole of the supply source. The resistance is then decreased until the power consumed by the resistor reaches a maximum. Points closest to the supply source at which the maximum power delivered to this resistor does not exceed 15 W at the end of 5 s are called low-power points. The part of the circuit farther from the supply source than a low-power point is considered to be a low-power circuit.NOTE 1 The measurements should be made from only one pole of the supply source, preferably the one that gives the fewest low-power points.NOTE 2 When determining the low-power points, it is recommended to start with points close to the supply source.NOTE 3 The power consumed by the variable resistor should be measured by a wattmeter.The following fault conditions are considered and, if necessary, applied one at a time, consequential faults being taken into consideration:short circuit of functional insulation if clearances or creepage distances are less than the values specified in Clause 29;open circuit at the terminals of any component;short circuit of capacitors, unless they comply with IEC 60384-14;short circuit of any two terminals of an electronic component, other than an integrated circuit. This fault condition is not applied between the two circuits of an optocoupler;failure of triacs in the diode mode;failure of microprocessors and integrated circuits except components such as thyristors and triacs. All possible output signals are considered for faults occurring within the component. If it can be shown that a particular output signal is unlikely to occur, then the relevant fault is not considered.failure of an electronic power switching device in a partial turn-on mode with loss of gate (base) control.\u2013 52 \u2013 60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010NOTE 1 This mode may be simulated by disconnecting the electronic power switching device gate (base) terminal and connecting an external adjustable power supply between the gate (base) terminal and the source (emitter) terminal of the electronic power switching device. The power supply is then varied so as to achieve a current that will not damage the electronic power switching device but will give the most onerous conditions of test.NOTE 2 Examples of electronic power switching devices are field effect transistors (FET\u2019s and MOSFET\u2019s) and bipolar transistors (including IGBT\u2019s).Fault condition f) is applied to encapsulated and similar components if the circuit cannot be assessed by other methods.Positive temperature coefficient resistors are not short-circuited if they are used within the manufacturer's specification. However, PTC-S thermistors are short-circuited unless they comply with IEC 60738-1.In addition, each low-power circuit is short-circuited by connecting the low-power point to the pole of the supply source from which the measurements were made.For simulation of the fault conditions, the appliance is operated under the conditions specified in Clause 11 but supplied at rated voltage.When any of the fault conditions are simulated, the duration of the test isas specified in 11.7 but only for one operating cycle and only if the fault cannot be recognized by the user, for example, a change in temperature;as specified in 19.7, if the fault can be recognized by the user, for example, when the motor of a kitchen machine stops;until steady conditions are established, for circuits continuously connected to the supply mains, for example, stand-by circuits.In each case, the test is ended if a non-self-resetting interruption of the supply occurs within the appliance.If the appliance incorporates a protective electronic circuit which operates to ensure compliance with Clause 19, the relevant test is repeated with a single fault simulated, as indicated in a) to g) of 19.11.2.NOTE The compliance criteria applied for these tests are those detailed in 19.13.Appliances having a device with an off position obtained by electronic disconnection, or a device that can be placed in the stand-by mode, are subjected to the tests of 19.11.4.1 to 19.11.4.7. The tests are carried out with the appliance supplied at rated voltage, the device being set in the off position or in the stand-by mode.Appliances incorporating a protective electronic circuit are subjected to the tests ofto 19.11.4.7. The tests are carried out after the protective electronic circuit has operated during the relevant tests of Clause 19 except 19.2, 19.6 and 19.11.3. However, appliances that are operated for 30 s or 5 min during the test of 19.7 are not subjected to the tests for electromagnetic phenomena.The tests are carried  out with surge  protective devices disconnected,  unless they incorporate spark gaps.NOTE 1 If the appliance has several modes of operation, the tests are carried out with the appliance operating in each mode, if necessary.NOTE 2 Appliances incorporating electronic controls complying with the IEC 60730 series of standards are not exempt from the tests.60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010 \u2013 53 \u2013The appliance is subjected to electrostatic discharges in accordance with IEC 61000-4-2, test level 4 being applicable. Ten discharges having a positive polarity and ten discharges having a negative polarity are applied at each preselected point.The appliance is subjected to radiated fields in accordance with IEC 61000-4-3, test level 3 being applicable.The frequency ranges tested shall be 80 MHz to 1 000 MHz and 1,4 GHz to 2,0 GHz.NOTE The dwell time for each frequency is to be sufficient to observe a possible malfunction of the protectiveelectronic circuit.The appliance is subjected to fast transient bursts in accordance with IEC 61000-4-4. Test level 3 with a repetition rate of 5 kHz is applicable for signal and control lines. Test level 4 with a repetition rate of 5 kHz is applicable for the power supply lines. The bursts are applied for 2 min with a positive polarity and for 2 min with a negative polarity.The power supply terminals of the appliance are subjected to voltage surges in accordance with IEC 61000-4-5, five positive impulses and five negative impulses being applied at the selected points. Test level 3 is applicable for the line-to-line coupling mode, a generator having a source impedance of 2 \u03a9 being used. Test level 4 is applicable for the line-to-earth coupling mode, a generator having a source impedance of 12 \u03a9 being used.Earthed heating elements in class I appliances are disconnected during this test.NOTE If a feedback system depends on inputs related to a disconnected heating element, an artificial network may be needed.For appliances having surge arresters incorporating spark gaps, the test is repeated at a level that is 95 % of the flashover voltage.The appliance is subjected to injected currents in accordance with IEC 61000-4-6, test level 3 being applicable. During the test, all frequencies between 0,15 MHz to 80 MHz are covered.NOTE The dwell time for each frequency is to be sufficient to observe a possible malfunction of the protective electronic circuit.For appliances having a rated current not exceeding 16 A, the appliance is subjected to the class 3 voltage dips and interruptions in accordance with IEC 61000-4-11. The values specified in Table 1 and Table 2 of IEC 61000-4-11 are applied at zero crossing of the supply voltage.For appliances having a rated current exceeding 16 A, the appliance is subjected to the class 3 voltage dips and interruptions in accordance with IEC 61000-4-34. The values specified in Table 1 and Table 2 of IEC 61000-4-34 are applied at zero crossing of the supply voltage.The appliance is subjected to mains signals in accordance with IEC 61000-4-13, Table 11 with test level class 2 using the frequency steps according to Table 10.The appliance is supplied at rated voltage and operated under normal operation. After approximately 60 s, the power supply voltage is reduced to a level such that the appliance ceases to respond to user inputs or parts controlled by the programmable component cease to operate, whichever occurs first. This value of supply voltage is recorded. The appliance is supplied at rated voltage and operated under normal operation. The voltage is then reduced to a value of approximately 10 % less than the recorded voltage. It is held at this value for approximately 60 s and then increased to rated voltage. The rate of decrease and increase of the power supply voltage is to be approximately 10 V/s.\u2013 54 \u2013 60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010The appliance shall continue to either operate normally from the same point in its operating cycle at which the voltage decrease occurred or a manual operation shall be required to restart it.If safety of the appliance depends upon the operation of a miniature fuse-link complying with IEC 60127 during any of the fault conditions specified in 19.11.2, the test is repeated but with the miniature fuse-link replaced by an ammeter. If the current measureddoes not exceed 2,1 times the rated current of the fuse-link, the circuit is not considered to be adequately protected and the test is carried out with the fuse-link short-circuited;is at least 2,75 times the rated current of the fuse-link, the circuit is considered to be adequately protected;is between 2,1 times and 2,75 times the rated current of the fuse-link, the fuse link is short-circuited and the test is carried outfor the relevant period or for 30 min, whichever is the shorter, for quick acting fuse- links;for the relevant period or for 2 min, whichever is the shorter, for time lag fuse-links.NOTE 1 In case of doubt, the maximum resistance of the fuse-link has to be taken into account when determining the current.NOTE 2 The verification whether the fuse-link acts as a protective device is based on the fusing characteristics specified in IEC 60127, which also gives the information necessary to calculate the maximum resistance of the fuse-link.NOTE 3 Other fuses are considered to be intentionally weak parts in accordance with 19.1.During the tests, the appliance shall not emit flames, molten metal, or poisonous or ignitable gas in hazardous amounts and temperature rises shall not exceed the values shown in Table 9.After the tests, and when the appliance has cooled to approximately room temperature, compliance with Clause 8 shall not be impaired and the appliance shall comply with 20.2 if it can still be operated.Table 9 \u2013 Maximum abnormal temperature  risePartTemperature riseKWooden supports, walls, ceiling and floor of the test corner and wooden cabinets a150Insulation of the supply cord a without T marking, or with T marking up to 75 \u00b0C150Insulation of the supply cord a with T marking above 75 \u00b0CT+75Supplementary insulation and reinforced insulation other than thermoplastic materials b1,5 times the relevant value specified in Table 3a bFor motor-operated appliances, these temperature rises are not determined.There is no specific limit for supplementary insulation and reinforced insulation of thermoplastic material. However, the temperature rise has to be determined so that the test of 30.1 can be carried out.When the insulation, other than that of class III appliances or class III constructions that do not contain live parts, has cooled down to approximately room temperature, it shall withstand the electric strength test of 16.3, the test voltage, however, being as specified in Table 4.The humidity treatment of 15.3 is not applied before this electric strength test.60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010 \u2013 55 \u2013For appliances which are immersed in or filled with conducting liquid in normal use, the appliance is immersed in or filled with water for 24 h before the electric strength test is carried out.After the operation or interruption of a control, clearances and creepage distances across the functional insulation shall withstand the electric strength test of 16.3, the test voltage, however, being twice the working voltage.The appliance shall not undergo a dangerous malfunction, and there shall be no failure ofprotective electronic circuits if the appliance is still operable.Appliances tested with an electronic switch in the off position, or in the stand-by mode, shallnot become operational, orif they become operational, not result in a dangerous malfunction during or after the tests of 19.11.4.NOTE Unintended operation that may impair safety, can result from careless use of appliances, such as:storage of small appliances while connected to the supply;placing flammable material on working surfaces of heating appliances; orplacing objects in areas near motorized appliances that are not expected to start.In an appliance containing lids or doors that are controlled by one or more interlocks, one of the interlocks may be released provided that both of the following conditions are fulfilled:the lid or door does not move automatically to an open position when the interlock is released;the appliance will not restart after the cycle in which the interlock was released.Appliances are operated under the conditions of Clause 11. Any contactor or relay contact that operates under the conditions of Clause 11 is short-circuited.If a relay or contactor with more than one contact is used, all contacts are short-circuited at the same time.Any relay or contactor which operates only in order to ensure that the appliance is energized for normal use and that does not otherwise operate in normal use is not short-circuited.If more than one relay or contactor operates in Clause 11, each such relay or contactor is short-circuited in turn.NOTE If the appliance has several modes of operation, the tests are carried out with the appliance operating in each mode, if necessary.For appliances incorporating a mains voltage selector switch, this switch is set to the lowest rated voltage position and the highest value of rated voltage is applied.", "Appliances, other than fixed appliances and hand-held appliances, intended to be used on a surface such as the floor or a table, shall have adequate stability.Compliance is checked by the following test, appliances incorporating an appliance inlet being fitted with an appropriate connector and flexible cord.\u2013 56 \u2013 60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010The appliance, not connected to the supply mains, is placed in any normal position of use on a plane inclined at an angle of 10\u00b0 to the horizontal, the supply cord resting on the inclined plane in the most unfavourable position. However, if part of an appliance comes into contact with the horizontal supporting surface when the appliance is tilted through an angle of 10\u00b0, the appliance is placed on a horizontal support and tilted in the most unfavourable direction through an angle of 10\u00b0.NOTE The test on the horizontal support may be necessary for appliances provided with rollers, castors or feet. In this case, castors or wheels may be blocked to prevent the appliance from rolling.Appliances provided with doors are tested with the doors open or closed, whichever is the more unfavourable.Appliances intended to be filled with liquid by the user in normal use are tested empty or filled with the most unfavourable quantity of water up to the capacity indicated in the instructions.The appliance shall not overturn.The test is repeated on appliances with heating elements with the angle of inclination increased to 15\u00b0. If the appliance overturns in one or more positions, it is subjected to the tests of Clause 11 in each of these overturned positions.During this test, temperature rises shall not exceed the values shown in Table 9.Moving parts of appliances shall, as far as is compatible with the use and working of the appliance, be positioned or enclosed to provide adequate protection against personal injury in normal use. This requirement does not apply to parts of an appliance that necessarily have to be exposed to allow the appliance to perform its working function.NOTE 1 Examples of parts of appliances necessarily exposed to perform the working function include the needle of a sewing machine, rotating brushes of vacuum cleaner and the blade of an electrical knife.Protective enclosures, guards and similar parts shall be non-detachable parts and shall have adequate mechanical strength. However, enclosures that can be opened by overriding an interlock by applying the test probe are considered to be detachable parts.The unexpected closure of self-resetting thermal cut-outs and overcurrent protective devices shall not cause a hazard.NOTE 2 An example of an appliance in which self-resetting thermal cut-outs and overcurrent protective devices could cause a hazard is a food mixer.Compliance is checked by inspection, by the test of 21.1 and by applying a force not exceeding 5 N by means of a test probe that is similar to test probe B of IEC 61032 but having a circular stop face with a diameter of 50 mm, instead of the non-circular face.For appliances provided with movable devices such as those intended for varying the tension of belts, the test with the test probe is carried out with these devices adjusted to the most unfavourable position within their range of adjustment. If necessary, belts are removed.It shall not be possible to touch dangerous moving parts with this test probe.", "Appliances shall have adequate mechanical strength and be constructed to withstand such rough handling that may be expected in normal use.60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010 \u2013 57 \u2013Compliance is checked by applying blows to the appliance in accordance with test Ehb of IEC 60068-2-75, the spring hammer test.The appliance is rigidly supported and three blows, having an impact energy of 0,5 J, are applied to every point of the enclosure that is likely to be weak.If necessary, the blows are also applied to handles, levers, knobs and similar parts and to signal lamps and their covers but only if the lamps or covers protrude from the enclosure by more than 10 mm or if their surface area exceeds 4 cm2. Lamps within the appliance and their covers are only tested if they are likely to be damaged in normal use.NOTE When applying the release cone to the guard of a visibly glowing heating element, care is to be taken that the hammer head passing through the guard does not strike the heating element.After the test, the appliance shall show no damage that could impair compliance with this standard and compliance with 8.1, 15.1 and Clause 29 shall not be impaired. In case of doubt, supplementary insulation and reinforced insulation are subjected to the electric strength test of 16.3.Damage to the finish, small dents that do not reduce clearances or creepage distances below the values specified in Clause 29, and small chips that do not adversely affect protection against access to live parts or moisture, are ignored.If a decorative cover is protected by an inner cover, fracture of the decorative cover is ignored if the inner cover itself withstands the test.If there is doubt as to whether a defect has occurred by the application of the preceding blows or the previous tests, this defect is neglected and the group of three blows is applied to the same place on a new sample which shall then withstand the test.Cracks not visible to the naked eye and surface cracks in fibre-reinforced mouldings and similar materials are ignored.Accessible parts  of solid insulation shall  have sufficient strength to prevent penetration by sharp implements.Compliance is checked by subjecting the insulation to the following test, unless the thickness of supplementary insulation is at least 1 mm and that of reinforced insulation is at least 2 mm.The insulation is raised to the temperature measured during the test of Clause 11. The surface of the insulation is then scratched by means of a hardened steel pin, the end of which has the form of a cone with an angle of 40\u00b0. Its tip is rounded with a radius of 0,25 mm \u00b1 0,02 mm. The pin is held at any angle from 80\u00b0 to 85\u00b0 to the horizontal and loaded so that the force exerted along its axis is 10 N \u00b1 0,5 N. The scratches are made by drawing the pin along the surface of the insulation at a speed of approximately 20 mm/s. Two parallel scratches are made. They are spaced sufficiently apart so that they are not affected by each other, their length covering approximately 25 % of the length of the insulation. Two similar scratches are made at 90\u00b0 to the first pair without crossing them.The test fingernail of Figure 7 is then applied to the scratched surface with a force of approximately 10 N.

The object of IEC is to promote international co-operation on all questions concerning standardization in the electrical and electronic fields. To this end and in addition to other activities, IEC publishes International Standards, Technical Specifications, Technical Reports, Publicly Available Specifications (PAS) and Guides (hereafter referred to as \u201cIEC Publication(s)\u201d). Their preparation is entrusted to technical committees; any IEC National Committee interested in the subject dealt with may participate in this preparatory work. International, governmental and non- governmental organizations liaising with the IEC also participate in this preparation. IEC collaborates closely with the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in accordance with conditions determined by agreement between the two organizations.The formal decisions or agreements of IEC on technical matters express, as nearly as possible, an international consensus of opinion on the relevant subjects since each technical committee has representation from all interested IEC National Committees.IEC Publications have the form of recommendations for international use and are accepted by IEC National Committees in that sense. While all reasonable efforts are made to ensure that the technical content of IEC Publications is accurate, IEC cannot be held responsible for the way in which they are used or for any misinterpretation by any end user.In order to promote international uniformity, IEC National Committees undertake to apply IEC Publications transparently to the maximum extent possible in their national and regional publications. Any divergence between any IEC Publication and the corresponding national or regional publication shall be clearly indicated in the latter.IEC itself does not provide any attestation of conformity. Independent certification bodies provide conformity assessment services and, in some areas, access to IEC marks of conformity. IEC is not responsible for any services carried out by independent certification bodies.All users should ensure that they have the latest edition of this publication.No liability shall attach to IEC or its directors, employees, servants or agents including individual experts and members of its technical committees and IEC National Committees for any personal injury, property damage or other damage of any nature whatsoever, whether direct or indirect, or for costs (including legal fees) and expenses arising out of the publication, use of, or reliance upon, this IEC Publication or any other IEC Publications.Attention is drawn to the Normative references cited in this publication. Use of the referenced publications is indispensable for the correct application of this publication.Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this IEC Publication may be the subject of patent rights.

It constitutes a technical revision.The principal changes in this edition as compared with the fourth edition of IEC 60335-1 are as follows (minor changes are not listed):updated the text of the standard to align with the most recent editions of the dated normative references;modified the functional safety requirements using  programmable electronic  circuits including software validation requirements;updated Clause 29 to cover insulation requirements subjected to high frequency voltages as in switch mode power supply circuits;\u2013 6 \u2013 60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010updated Subclause 30.2 to further align the pre-selection option with the end-product test option;deleted some notes and converted many other notes to normative text;clarified requirements for class III appliances and class III constructions. The text of this standard is based on the following documents:FDISReport on voting61/3974/FDIS61/4014/RVDFull information on the voting for the approval of this standard can be found in the report on voting indicated in the above table.This publication has been drafted in accordance with the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2.This part is to be used in conjunction with the appropriate part 2 of IEC 60335. The parts 2 contain clauses to supplement or modify the corresponding clauses in this part to provide the relevant requirements for each type of appliance.NOTE 1 The following annexes contain provisions suitably modified from other IEC standards:\u2013 Annex ENeedle-flame testIEC 60695-11-5\u2013 Annex FCapacitorsIEC 60384-14\u2013 Annex GSafety isolating transformersIEC 61558-1 and IEC 61558-2-6\u2013 Annex HSwitchesIEC 61058-1\u2013 Annex JCoated printed circuit boardsIEC 60664-3\u2013 Annex NProof tracking testIEC 60112\u2013 Annex RSoftware evaluationIEC 60730-1NOTE 2 The following print types are used:requirements: in roman type;test specifications: in italic type;\u2013 notes: in small roman type.Words in bold in the text are defined in Clause 3. When a definition concerns an adjective, the adjective and associated noun are also in bold.A list of all parts of the IEC 60335 series, under the general title: Household and similar electrical appliances \u2013 Safety, can be found on the IEC website.The committee has decided that the contents of this publication will remain unchanged until the stability date indicated on the IEC web site under \"http://webstore.iec.ch\" in the data related to the specific publication. At this date, the publication will bereconfirmed,withdrawn,replaced by a revised edition, oramended.NOTE 3 The attention of National Committees is drawn to the fact that equipment manufacturers and testing organizations may need a transitional period following publication of a new, amended or revised IEC publication in which to make products in accordance with the new requirements and to equip themselves for conducting new or revised tests.It is the recommendation of the committee that the content of this publication be adopted for implementation nationally not earlier than 12 months or later than 36 months from the date of publication.60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010 \u2013 7 \u2013The following differences exist in the countries indicated below.Introduction: The Part 1 standard (UL60335-1) is only used in combination with a part 2 (UL60335-2-x).National differences are specified in these standards (USA).5.7: The ambient temperature is 25 \u00b0C \u00b1 10 \u00b0C (Japan).5.7: The ambient temperature is 27 \u00b0C \u00b1 5 \u00b0C (India).6.1: Class 0 appliances and class 0I appliances are not allowed (Australia, Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, India, Israel, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Singapore, Slovakia, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom).7.12.2: The requirements for full disconnection do not apply (Japan).13.2: The test circuit and some leakage current limits are different (India).22.2: The second paragraph of this subclause dealing with single-phase class I appliances with heating elements cannot be complied with because of the supply system (France and Norway).22.2: Double-pole switches or protective devices are required (Norway).22.35 Accessible metal parts separated from live parts by earthed metal parts are not regarded as likely to become live in the event of an insulation fault (USA).24.1: IEC component standard requirements are replaced by the relevant requirements of component standards specified in UL60335-1 and parts 2 (UL60335-2-x) (USA).25.3: A set of supply leads is not permitted (Norway, Denmark, Finland, Netherlands).25.8: 0,5 mm2 supply cords are not allowed for class I appliances (Australia and New Zealand).26.6: Conductor cross-sectional areas are different (USA).29.1: Different rated impulse voltages are used between 50 V and 150 V (Japan).\u2013 8 \u2013 60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010INTRODUCTIONIt has been assumed in the drafting of this International Standard that the execution of its provisions is entrusted to appropriately qualified and experienced persons.This standard recognizes the internationally accepted level of protection against hazards such as electrical, mechanical, thermal, fire and radiation of appliances when operated as in normal use taking into account the manufacturer's instructions. It also covers abnormal situations that  can  be expected  in practice  and takes  into account  the way in which electromagnetic phenomena can affect the safe operation of appliances.This standard takes into account the requirements of IEC 60364 as far as possible so that there is compatibility with the wiring rules when the appliance is connected to the supply mains. However, national wiring rules may differ.If the functions of an appliance are covered by different parts 2 of IEC 60335, the relevant part 2 is applied to each function separately, as far as is reasonable. If applicable, the influence of one function on the other is taken into account.NOTE 1 Throughout this publication, when \u201cPart 2\u201d is mentioned, it refers to the relevant part of IEC 60335.When a part 2 standard does not include additional requirements to cover hazards dealt with in Part 1, Part 1 applies.NOTE 2 This means that the technical committees responsible for the part 2 standards have determined that it is not necessary to specify particular requirements for the appliance in question over and above the general requirements.This standard is a product family standard dealing with the safety of appliances and takes precedence over horizontal and generic standards covering the same subject.NOTE 3 Horizontal and generic standards covering a hazard are not applicable since they have been taken into consideration when developing the general and particular requirements for the IEC 60335 series of standards. For example, in the case of temperature requirements for surfaces on many appliances, generic standards, such as ISO 13732-1 for hot surfaces, are not applicable in addition to Part 1 or part 2 standards.Individual countries may wish to consider the application of the standard, as far as is reasonable, to appliances not mentioned in a part 2, and to appliances designed on new principles.An appliance that complies with the text of this standard will not necessarily be considered to comply with the safety principles of the standard if, when examined and tested, it is found to have other features which impair the level of safety covered by these requirements.An appliance employing materials or having forms of construction differing from those detailed in the requirements of this standard may be examined and tested according to the intent of the requirements and, if found to be substantially equivalent, may be considered to comply with the standard.NOTE 4 Standards dealing with non-safety aspects of household appliances areIEC standards published by TC 59 concerning methods of measuring performance;CISPR 11, CISPR 14-1, IEC 61000-3-2 and IEC 61000-3-3 concerning electromagnetic emissions;CISPR 14-2 concerning electromagnetic immunity;IEC standards published by TC 111 concerning environmental matters.60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010 \u2013 9 \u2013HOUSEHOLD AND SIMILAR ELECTRICAL APPLIANCES \u2013 SAFETY  \u2013Part 1: General requirementsScopeThis International Standard deals with the safety of electrical appliances for household and similar purposes, their rated voltage being not more than 250 V for single-phase appliances and 480 V for other appliances.NOTE 1 Battery-operated appliances and other d.c. supplied appliances are within the scope of this standard.Appliances not intended for normal household use but which nevertheless may be a source of danger to the public, such as appliances intended to be used by laymen in shops, in light industry and on farms, are within the scope of this standard.NOTE 2 Examples of such appliances are catering equipment, cleaning appliances for commercial use, and appliances for hairdressers.As far as is practicable, this standard  deals  with the  common hazards  presented by appliances that are encountered by all persons in and around the home. However, in general, it does not take into accountpersons (including children) whosephysical, sensory or mental capabilities; orlack of experience and knowledgeprevents them from using the appliance safely without supervision or instruction;children playing with the appliance.NOTE 3 Attention is drawn to the fact thatfor appliances intended to be used in vehicles or on board ships or aircraft, additional requirements may be necessary;in many countries, additional requirements are specified by the national health authorities, the national authorities responsible for the protection of labour, the national water supply authorities and similar authorities.NOTE 4 This standard does not apply toappliances intended exclusively for industrial purposes;appliances intended to be used in locations where special conditions prevail, such as the presence of a corrosive or explosive atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas);audio, video and similar electronic apparatus (IEC 60065);appliances for medical purposes (IEC 60601);hand-held motor-operated electric tools (IEC 60745);personal computers and similar equipment (IEC 60950-1);transportable motor-operated electric tools (IEC 61029).Normative referencesThe following referenced documents are indispensable for the application of this document.

In particular, the wiring and its connections shall withstand the electric strength test of 16.3, the test voltage being reduced to 1 000 V and applied between live parts and accessible metal parts only. In addition, not more than 10 % of the strands of any conductor of the internal wiring between the main part of the appliance and the movable part shall be broken.

However, the tests of Clauses 20, 22 (except 22.10, 22.11 and 22.18) to 26, 28, 30 and 31 may be carried out on separate appliances. The test of 22.3 is carried out on a new appliance.NOTE 1 Additional samples may be required if the appliance has to be tested under different conditions, for example if it can be supplied with different voltages.If an intentionally weak part becomes open circuit during the tests of Clause 19, an additional appliance may be needed.The testing of components may require the submission of additional samples of these components. If the test of Annex C has to be carried out, six samples of the motor are needed.If the test of Annex D has to be carried out, an additional appliance may be used. If the tests of Annex G are carried out, four additional transformers are needed.If the tests of Annex H are carried out, three switches or three additional appliances are needed.NOTE 2 The cumulative stress resulting from successive tests on electronic circuits is to be avoided. It may be necessary to replace components or to use additional samples. The number of additional samples should be kept to a minimum by an evaluation of the relevant electronic circuits.NOTE 3 If an appliance has to be dismantled in order to carry out a test, care is to be taken to ensure that it is reassembled as originally supplied. In case of doubt, subsequent tests may be carried out on a separate sample.The tests are carried out in the order of the clauses. However, the test of 22.11 on the appliance at room temperature is carried out before the tests of Clause 8. The tests of Clause 14 and 21.2 and 22.24 are carried out after the tests of Clause 29. The test of 19.14 is carried out before the tests of 19.11.If it is evident from the construction of the appliance that a particular test is not applicable, the test is not carried out.When testing appliances that are also supplied by other energies such as gas, the influence of their consumption has to be taken into account.The tests are carried out with the appliance or any movable part of it placed in the most unfavourable position that may occur in normal use.Appliances provided with controls or switching devices are tested with these controls or devices adjusted to their most unfavourable setting, if the setting can be altered by the user.NOTE 1 If the adjusting means of the control is accessible without the aid of a tool, this subclause applies whether the setting can be altered by hand or with the aid of a tool. If the adjusting means is not accessible without the aid of a tool and if the setting is not intended to be altered by the user, this subclause does not apply.NOTE 2 Adequate sealing is regarded as preventing alteration of the setting by the user.\u2013 22 \u2013 60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010For appliances fitted with a voltage selector switch, unless otherwise specified, the tests are carried out with the switch in the position corresponding to the rated voltage value used for the tests.The tests are carried out in a draught-free location at an ambient temperature of 20 \u00b0C \u00b1 5 \u00b0C.If the temperature attained by any part is limited by a temperature sensitive device or is influenced by the temperature at which a change of state occurs, for example when water boils, the ambient temperature is maintained at 23 \u00b0C \u00b1 2 \u00b0C in case of doubt.Test conditions relating to frequency and voltageAppliances for a.c. only are tested with a.c. at rated frequency, and those for a.c. andd.c. are tested at the more unfavourable supply.Appliances for a.c. that are not marked with rated frequency or are marked with a rated frequency range of 50 Hz to 60 Hz are tested with either 50 Hz or 60 Hz, whichever is the more unfavourable.Appliances having more than one rated voltage are tested on the basis of the most unfavourable voltage.For motor-operated appliances, and combined appliances, marked with a rated voltage range, when it is specified that the supply voltage is equal to the rated voltage multiplied by a factor, the appliance is supplied atthe upper limit of the rated voltage range multiplied by this factor, if greater than 1;the lower limit of the rated voltage range multiplied by this factor, if smaller than 1.When a factor is not specified, the supply voltage is the most unfavourable within the rated voltage range.NOTE 1 If a heating appliance has a rated voltage range, the upper limit of the voltage range will usually be the most unfavourable voltage within the range.NOTE 2 For motor-operated appliances, combined appliances and appliances having more than one rated voltage or rated voltage range, it may be necessary to make some of the tests at the minimum, the mean and the maximum values of the rated voltage or the rated voltage range in order to establish the most unfavourable voltage.For heating appliances, and combined appliances, marked with a rated power input range, when it is specified that the power input is equal to the rated power input multiplied by a factor, the appliance is operated atthe upper limit of the rated power input range multiplied by this factor, if greater than 1;the lower limit of the rated power input range multiplied by this factor, if smaller than 1.When a factor is not specified, the power input is the most unfavourable within the rated power input range.For appliances  marked with  a rated voltage  range  and rated  power input corresponding to the mean of the rated voltage range, when it is specified that the power input is equal to rated power input multiplied by a factor, the appliance is operated atthe calculated power input corresponding to the upper limit of the rated voltage rangemultiplied by this factor, if greater than 1;60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010 \u2013 23 \u2013the calculated power input corresponding to the lower limit of the rated voltage rangemultiplied by this factor, if smaller than 1.When a factor is not specified, the power input corresponds to the power input at the most unfavourable voltage within the rated voltage range.When alternative heating elements or accessories are made available by the appliance manufacturer, the appliance is tested with those elements or accessories which give the most unfavourable results.The tests are carried out on the  appliance as supplied. However,  an appliance constructed as a single appliance but supplied in a number of units is tested after assembly in accordance with the instructions provided with the appliance.Built-in appliances and fixed appliances are installed in accordance with the instructions provided with the appliance before testing.Appliances intended to be connected to fixed wiring by means of a flexible cord are tested with the appropriate flexible cord connected to the appliance.For heating appliances and combined appliances, when it is specified that the appliance has to operate at a power input multiplied by a factor, this applies only to heating elements without appreciable positive temperature coefficient of resistance.For heating elements with appreciable positive temperature coefficient of resistance, other than PTC heating elements, the supply voltage is determined by supplying the appliance at rated voltage until the heating element reaches its operating temperature. The supply voltage is then rapidly increased to the value necessary to give the power input required for the relevant test, this value of the supply voltage being maintained throughout the test.NOTE In general, the temperature coefficient is considered to be appreciable if, at rated voltage, the power input of the appliance in cold condition differs by more than 25 % from the power input at operating temperature.The tests for appliances with PTC heating elements and for heating appliances and combined appliances where the heating elements are supplied via a switch mode power supply are carried out at a voltage corresponding to the specified power input.When a power input greater than the rated power input is specified, the factor for multiplying the voltage is equal to the square root of the factor for multiplying the power input.If class 0I appliances or class I appliances have accessible metal parts that are not earthed and are not separated from live parts by an intermediate metal part that is earthed, such parts are checked for compliance with the appropriate requirements specified for class II construction.If class 0I appliances or class I appliances have accessible non-metallic parts, such parts are checked for compliance with the appropriate requirements specified for class II construction unless these parts are separated from live parts by an intermediate metal part that is earthed.NOTE Guidance is given in Annex P for enhanced requirements that may be used to ensure an acceptable level of protection against electrical and thermal hazards for particular types of appliances used in an installation without a protective earthing conductor in countries that have warm damp equable climates.If appliances have parts operating at safety extra-low voltage, such parts are checked for compliance with the appropriate requirements specified for class III construction.\u2013 24 \u2013 60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010When testing electronic circuits, the supply is to be free from perturbations from external sources that can influence the results of the tests.Appliances powered by rechargeable batteries are tested in accordance with Annex B.If linear and angular dimensions are specified without a tolerance, ISO 2768-1 is applicable.If a component or part of the appliance has both a self resetting feature and a non- self-resetting feature and if the non-self-resetting feature is not required in order to comply with the standard, then appliances incorporating such a component or part shall be tested with the non-self-resetting feature rendered inoperative.ClassificationAppliances shall be of one of the following classes with respect to protection against electric shock:class 0, class 0I, class I, class II, class III.Compliance is checked by inspection and by the relevant tests.Appliances shall have the appropriate degree of protection against harmful ingress of water.Compliance is checked by inspection and by the relevant tests.NOTE The degrees of protection against harmful ingress of water are given in IEC 60529.Marking and instructionsAppliances shall be marked with therated voltage or rated voltage range in volts;symbol for nature of supply, unless the rated frequency is marked;rated power input in watts or rated current in amperes;name, trade mark or identification mark of the manufacturer or responsible vendor;model or type reference;symbol IEC 60417-5172 (2003-02) for class II appliances only;IP number according to degree of protection against ingress of water, other than IPX0;symbol IEC 60417-5180 (2003-02), for class  III appliances. This marking  is not necessary for appliances that are operated only by batteries  (primary batteries  or secondary batteries that are recharged outside of the appliance).NOTE 1 The first numeral of the IP number need not be marked on the appliance.NOTE 2 Additional markings are allowed provided they do not give rise to misunderstanding.NOTE 3 If components are marked separately, the marking of the appliance and that of the components is to be such that there can be no doubt with regard to the marking of the appliance itself.NOTE 4 If the appliance is marked with rated pressure, the units used may be bars but only together with pascals and placed in brackets.60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010 \u2013 25 \u2013The enclosure of electrically-operated water valves incorporated in external hose-sets for connection of an appliance to the water mains shall be marked with symbol IEC 60417-5036 (2002-10) if their working voltage exceeds extra-low voltage.Compliance is checked by inspection.Stationary appliances for multiple supply shall be marked with the substance of the following:Warning: Before obtaining access to terminals, all supply circuits must be disconnected.This warning shall be placed in the vicinity of the terminal cover.Compliance is checked by inspection.Appliances having  a range  of rated  values  and which can be operated without adjustment throughout the range shall be marked with the lower and upper limits of the range separated by a hyphen.NOTE 1 Example: 115-230 V: The appliance is suitable for any value within the marked range (a curling iron with a PTC heating element or an appliance incorporating an input switch mode power supply).Appliances having different rated values and which have to be adjusted for use at a particular value by the user or installer shall be marked with the different values separated by an oblique stroke.NOTE 2 Example: 115/230 V: The appliance is only suitable for the marked values (a shaver with a selector switch).NOTE 3 This requirement is also applicable to appliances with provision for connection to both single-phase and multi-phase supplies.Example: 230 V/400 V: The appliance is only suitable for the voltage values indicated, 230 V being for single- phase operation and 400 V for three-phase operation (a dishwasher with terminals for both supplies).Compliance is checked by inspection.If the appliance can be adjusted for different rated voltages, the voltage to which the appliance is adjusted shall be clearly discernible. If frequent changes in voltage setting are not required, this requirement is considered to  be met if the rated voltage to which the appliance is to be adjusted can be determined from a wiring diagram fixed to the appliance.NOTE The wiring diagram may be on the inside of a cover that has to be removed to connect the supply conductors. It is not to be on a label loosely attached to the appliance.Compliance is checked by inspection.For appliances marked with more than one rated voltage or with one or more rated voltage ranges, the rated power input or rated current for each of these voltages or ranges shall be marked. However, if the difference between the limits of a rated voltage range does not exceed 10 % of the arithmetic mean value of the range, the marking for rated power input or rated current may be related to the arithmetic mean value of the range.The upper and lower limits of the rated power input or rated current shall be marked on the appliance so that the relation between input and voltage is clear.Compliance is checked by inspection.When symbols are used, they shall be as follows\u2013 26 \u2013 60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010[symbol IEC 60417- 5031(2002-10)]direct current[symbol IEC 60417- 5032(2002-10)]alternating current3                [symbol IEC 60417- 5032-1(2002-10)]three-phase alternating current3N            [symbol IEC 60417- 5032-2(2002-10)]three-phase alternating current with neutral[symbol IEC 60417- 5016(2002-10)]fuse-linkNOTE 1 The rated current of the fuse link may be indicated in association with this symbol.time-lag miniature fuse-link  where X is the symbol  for the time/current characteristic as given in IEC 60127[symbol IEC 60417- 5019(2006-08)][symbol IEC 60417- 5018(2006-10)][symbol IEC 60417- 5172(2003-02)][symbol IEC 60417- 5012(2002-10)]protective earthfunctional earthingclass II equipmentlampNOTE 2 The rated wattage of the lamp may be indicated in association with this symbol.[symbol ISO 7000-0434(2004-01)]caution[symbol ISO 7000-0790(2004-01)]read operator's manual[symbol IEC 60417- 5021(2002-10)]equipotentiality[symbol IEC 60417-5036(2002-10)]dangerous voltage[symbol IEC 60417-5180(2003-02)]Class III applianceThe symbol for nature of supply shall be placed next to the marking for rated voltage.60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010 \u2013 27 \u2013The symbol for class II appliances shall be placed so that it will be obvious that it is a part of the technical information and is unlikely to be confused with any other marking.Units of physical quantities and their symbols shall be those of the international standardized system.NOTE 3 Additional symbols are allowed provided that they do not give rise to misunderstanding.

The force is2 N, for bare conductors;30 N, for accessible surfaces.The force is applied by means of test probe B of IEC 61032. Apertures are assumed to be covered by a piece of flat metal.NOTE 3 The way in which clearances are measured is specified in IEC 60664-1. NOTE 4 The procedure for assessing clearances is given in Annex L.NOTE 5 For appliances intended for use at altitudes exceeding 2 000 m, the altitude correction factors forclearances specified in Table A.2 of IEC 60664-1 should be taken into account.The clearances of basic insulation shall be sufficient to withstand the overvoltages likely to occur during use, taking into account the rated impulse voltage. The values of Table 16, or the impulse voltage test of Clause 14, are applicable.NOTE The overvoltages may be derived from external sources or due to switching.The clearance at the terminals of tubular sheathed heating elements may be reduced to 1,0 mm if the microenvironment is pollution degree 1.Lacquered conductors of windings are considered to be bare conductors.Compliance is checked by measurement.60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010 \u2013 91 \u2013Clearances of supplementary insulation shall be not less than those specified forbasic insulation in Table 16.Compliance is checked by measurement.Clearances of reinforced insulation shall be not less than those specified for basic insulation in Table 16, using the next higher step for rated impulse voltage as a reference.Compliance is checked  by measurement.  For double  insulation, when there  is no intermediate conductive part between the basic insulation and supplementary insulation, clearances are measured between live parts and the accessible surface, and the insulation system is treated as reinforced insulation as shown in Figure 11.The clearances for functional insulation are the largest values determined fromTable 16 based on the rated impulse voltage;Table F.7a in IEC 60664-1 based on the steady-state voltage or recurring peak voltage expected to occur across it, if the frequency of the steady-state voltage or recurring peak voltage does not exceeds 30 kHz;Clause 4 of IEC 60664-4 based on the steady-state voltage or recurring peak  voltage expected to occur across it, if the frequency of the steady-state voltage or recurring peak voltage exceeds 30 kHz.If the values of Table 16 are largest, the impulse voltage test of Clause 14 may be applied instead unless the microenvironment is pollution degree 3 or the construction is such that the distances could be affected by wear, by distortion, by movement of the parts or during assembly.However, clearances are not specified if  the appliance complies with Clause 19 with thefunctional insulation short-circuited.Lacquered conductors of windings  are considered to be bare conductors. However,clearances at crossover points are not measured.The clearance between surfaces of PTC heating elements may be reduced to 1 mm.Compliance is checked by measurement and by a test if necessary.For appliances having higher working voltages than rated voltage, for example on the secondary side of a step-up transformer, or if there is a resonant voltage, the clearances for basic insulation are the largest values determined fromTable 16 based on the rated impulse voltage;Table F.7a in IEC 60664-1 based on the steady-state voltage or recurring peak voltage expected to occur across it, if the frequency of the steady-state voltage or recurring peak voltage does not exceed 30 kHz;Clause 4 of IEC 60664-4 based on the steady-state voltage or recurring peak voltage expected to occur across it, if the frequency of the steady-state voltage or recurring peak voltage exceeds 30 kHz.NOTE 1 Clearances for intermediate values of Table 16 may be determined by interpolation.If the clearances applied for basic insulation are selected from Table F.7a of IEC 60664-1 or Clause 4 of IEC 60664-4, then the clearances of supplementary insulation shall be not less than those specified for basic insulation.\u2013 92 \u2013 60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010If the clearances applied for basic insulation are selected from Table F.7a of IEC 60664-1, then the clearances of reinforced  insulation shall  be dimensioned as specified in Table F.7a to withstand 160 % of the withstand voltage required for basic insulation.If the clearances applied for basic insulation are selected from Clause 4 of IEC 60664-4, then the clearances of reinforced insulation shall be twice the value required for basic insulation.If the secondary winding of a step-down transformer is earthed, or if there is an earthed screen between the primary and secondary windings, clearances of basic insulation on the secondary side shall be not less than those specified in Table 16, using the next lower step for rated impulse voltage as a reference.NOTE 2 The use of an isolating transformer without an earthed protective screen or earthed secondary does not allow a reduction in the rated impulse voltage.For circuits supplied with a voltage lower than rated voltage, for example on the secondary side of a transformer, clearances of functional insulation are based on the working voltage, which is used as the rated voltage in Table 15.Compliance is checked by measurement.Appliances shall be constructed so that creepage distances are not less than those appropriate for the working voltage, taking into account the material group and the pollution degree.NOTE 1 The working voltage for parts connected to the neutral is the same as for parts connected to the phase and this is the working voltage for basic insulation.Pollution degree 2 applies unlessprecautions have been taken to protect the insulation, in which case pollution degree 1 applies;the insulation is subjected to conductive pollution, in which case pollution degree 3 applies.NOTE 2 An explanation of pollution degree is given in Annex M.Compliance is checked by measurement.NOTE 3 The way in which creepage distances are measured is specified in IEC 60664-1.Parts such as hexagonal nuts that can be tightened to different positions during assembly, and movable parts are placed in the most unfavourable position.A force is applied to bare conductors, other than those of heating elements, and accessible surfaces to try to reduce creepage distances when making the measurement. The force is2 N, for bare conductors;30 N, for accessible surfaces.The force is applied by means of test probe B of IEC 61032.The relationship between the material group and the comparative tracking index (CTI) values, as given in Subclause 4.8.1.3 of IEC 60664-1, is as follows:material group I: 600 \u2264 CTI;material group II: 400 \u2264 CTI < 600;60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010 \u2013 93 \u2013material group IIIa: 175 \u2264 CTI < 400;material group IIIb: 100 \u2264 CTI < 175.These CTI values are obtained in accordance with IEC 60112 using solution A. If the CTI value of the material is unknown, a proof tracking index (PTI) test in accordance with Annex N is carried out at the CTI values specified, in order to establish the material group.NOTE 4 The test for comparative tracking index (CTI) in accordance with IEC 60112 is designed to compare the performance of various insulating materials under test conditions, namely drops of an aqueous contaminant falling on a horizontal surface leading to electrolytic conduction. It gives a qualitative comparison but in the case of insulating materials having a tendency to form tracks, it can also give a quantitative comparison, namely the comparative tracking index.NOTE 5 The procedure for assessing creepage distances is given in Annex L.In a double insulation system, the working voltage for both the basic insulation and supplementary insulation is taken as the working voltage across the complete double insulation system. It is not divided according to thickness and dielectric constants of the basic insulation and supplementary insulation.Creepage distances of basic insulation shall not be less than those specified in Table 17. However, if the working voltage is periodic and has a frequency that exceeds 30 kHz, the creepage distances shall also be determined from Table 2 of IEC 60664-4. These values shall be used instead if they exceed the values in Table 17.Except for pollution degree 1, if the test of Clause 14 has been used to check a particular clearance, the corresponding creepage distance shall not be less than the minimum dimension specified for the clearance of Table 16.\u2013 94 \u2013 60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010Table 17 \u2013  Minimum creepage distances for basic insulationWorking voltageVCreepage distancemmPollution degree123Material groupMaterial groupIIIIIIa/IIIbIIIIIIa/IIIb a\u2264 50125250400500>630 and \u2264800>800 and \u22641 000>1 000 and \u22641 250>1 250 and \u22641 600>1 600 and \u22642 000>2 000 and \u22642 500>2 500 and \u22643 200>3 200 and \u22644 000>4 000 and \u22645 000>5 000 and \u22646 300>6 300 and \u22648 000>8 000 and \u226410 000>10 000 and \u226412 5000,180,280,561,01,31,82,43,24,25,67,510,012,516,020,025,032,040,00,60,751,252,02,53,24,05,06,38,010,012,516,020,025,032,040,050,00,851,051,82,83,64,55,67,19,011,014,018,022,028,036,045,056,071,01,21,52,54,05,06,38,010,012,516,020,025,032,040,050,063,080,0100,01,51,93,25,06,38,010,012,516,020,025,032,040,050,063,080,0100,0125,01,72,13,65,67,19,011,014,018,022,028,036,045,056,071,090,0110,0140,01,92,44,06,38,010,012,516,020,025,032,040,050,063,080,0100,0125,0160,0NOTE 1 Lacquered conductors of windings are considered to be bare conductors, but creepage distancesneed not be greater than the associated clearance specified in Table 16 taking into account 29.1.1.NOTE 2 For glass, ceramics and other inorganic insulating  materials  that  do not  track,  creepage  distances need not be greater than the associated clearance.NOTE 3 Except for circuits on the secondary side of an isolating transformer, the working voltage is considered to be not less than the rated voltage of the appliance.NOTE 4   For working voltages >  50  V  and \u2264  630 V, if  the  voltage is  not specified in the  table, the values   of creepage distances may be found by interpolation.a Material group IIIb is allowed if the working voltage does not exceed 50 V.Compliance is checked by measurement.Creepage distances of supplementary insulation shall be at least those specified for basic insulation in Table 17 or Table 2 of IEC 60664-4, as applicable.NOTE Notes 1 and 2 of Table 17 do not apply.Compliance is checked by measurement.Creepage distances of reinforced insulation shall  be at least  double those specified for basic insulation in Table 17 or Table 2 of IEC 60664-4, as applicable.NOTE Notes 1 and 2 of Table 17 do not apply.Compliance is checked by measurement.60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010 \u2013 95 \u2013Creepage distances of functional insulation shall be not less than those specified in Table 18.

They are normally carried out on the complete appliance after assembly but the manufacturer may perform the tests at an appropriate stage during production, provided that later manufacturing processes do not affect the results.NOTE Components are not subjected to these tests if they have been previously subjected to routine tests during their manufacture.The manufacturer may use a different routine test procedure provided that the level of safety is equivalent to that provided by the tests specified in this annex.These tests are the minimum considered necessary to cover essential safety aspects. It is the manufacturer\u2019s responsibility to decide if additional routine tests are necessary. It may be determined from engineering considerations that some of the tests are impracticable or inappropriate and therefore need not be carried out.If a product fails any of the tests, it is to be retested after rework or adjustment.Earth continuity testA current of at least 10 A, derived from a source having a no-load voltage not exceeding 12 V (a.c. or d.c.), is passed between each of the accessible earthed metal parts andfor class 0I appliances, and for class I appliances intended to be permanently connected to fixed wiring, the earthing terminal;for other class I appliances,the earthing pin or earthing contact of the plug;the earthing pin of the appliance inlet.The voltage drop is measured and the resistance is calculated and shall not exceedfor appliances having a supply cord, 0,2 \u03a9, or 0,1 \u03a9 plus the resistance of the supply cord;\u2013 for other appliances, 0,1 \u03a9.NOTE 1 The test is only carried out for the duration necessary to enable the voltage drop to be measured.NOTE 2 Care is to be taken to ensure that the contact resistance between the tip of the measuring probe and the metal part under test does not influence the test results.Electric strength testThe insulation of the appliance is subjected to a voltage of substantially sinusoidal waveform having a frequency of approximately 50 Hz or 60 Hz for 1 s. The value of the test voltage and the points of application are shown in Table A.1.\u2013 116 \u2013 60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010Table A.1 \u2013 Test voltagesPoints of applicationTest voltageVClass 0 appliances, Class 0I appliances,Class I appliances and Class II appliancesClass III appliancesRated voltage400\u2013\u2264150 V>150 VBetween live parts andaccessible metal parts separated from live parts by8002 0001 0002 500a This test is not applicable for class 0 appliances.b For class 0I appliances and class I appliances, this test need not be carried out on  parts  of  class  II  construction if the test is considered to be inappropriate.basic insulation onlydouble or reinforced insulation a, bNOTE 1 It may be necessary for the appliance to be in operation during the test to ensure that the test voltage is applied to all relevant insulation, for example, heating elements controlled by a relay.No breakdown shall occur. Breakdown is assumed to occur when the current in the test circuit exceeds 5 mA. However, this limit may be increased up to 30 mA for appliances with a high leakage current.NOTE 2 The circuit used for the test incorporates a current sensing device that trips when the current exceeds the limit.NOTE 3 The high voltage transformer is to be capable of maintaining the specified voltage at the limiting current.NOTE 4 Instead of being subjected to an a.c. voltage, the insulation may be subjected to a d.c. voltage of 1,5 times the value shown in the table. An a.c. voltage having a frequency up to 5 Hz is considered to be a d.c. voltage.Functional testThe correct functioning of an appliance is checked by inspection or by an appropriate test if the incorrect connection or adjustment of components has safety implications.NOTE Examples are verification of the correct direction of motor rotation and the appropriate operation of interlock switches.

Overvoltage category is a numeral defining a transient overvoltage condition.Equipment of overvoltage category IV is for use at the origin of the installation.NOTE 1 Examples of such equipment are electricity meters and primary overcurrent protection equipment.Equipment of overvoltage category III is equipment in fixed installations and for cases where the reliability and the availability of the equipment is subject to special requirements.NOTE 2 Examples of such equipment are switches in the fixed installation and equipment for industrial use with permanent connection to the fixed installation.Equipment of overvoltage category II is energy consuming equipment to be supplied from the fixed installation.NOTE 3 Examples of such equipment are appliances, portable tools and other household and similar loads.If such equipment  is subjected  to special requirements with regard  to reliability and availability, overvoltage category III applies.Equipment of overvoltage category I is equipment for connection to circuits in which measures are taken to limit transient overvoltages to an appropriately low level.\u2013 132 \u2013 60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010Annex L(informative)Guidance for the measurement of clearances and creepage  distancesWhen measuring clearances, the following applies.The rated voltage and overvoltage category are determined (see Annex K).NOTE 1 In general, appliances are in overvoltage category II.The rated impulse voltage is determined from Table 15.If pollution degree 3 is applicable, or if the appliance is class 0 or class 01, the clearances for basic insulation and functional insulation are measured and compared with the minimum values specified in Table 16. For other cases, the impulse voltage test may be carried out if the rigidity requirements of 29.1 are met, otherwise the values specified in Table 16 apply. However, for functional insulation that is subjected to a steady-state voltage or recurring peak voltage with a frequency not exceeding 30 kHz, the clearances are also obtained from Table F.7a in IEC 60664-1 or if the frequency exceeds 30 kHz, Clause 4 in IEC 60664-4. The larger of the values so obtained is applied if they exceed the minimum values specified in Table 16.Clearances of supplementary insulation and reinforced insulation are measured and compared with the minimum values specified in Table 16.NOTE 2 Special considerations apply for clearances subjected to higher working voltages than rated voltage. For these requirements, refer to the text in 29.1.5.NOTE 3 The sequence for determining clearances is shown in Figure L.1.Rated voltageOvervoltage categoryRated impulse voltage(Table 15)Basic insulation(rigid parts)BasicinsulationClass I, II, III appliancesClass 0, 0I appliancesNo Pollution degree 3applicable YesTerminals of tubular sheathed heating elements(pollution degree 1)60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010Functional insulationImpulse voltage test (Clause 14)Minimum clearance (Table 16)No Pollution degree 3applicable ?Yes\u2013 133 \u2013YesTable 16Rigid part ?NoLargest applicablevalueTable F.7a of IEC 60664-1Clause 4 of IEC 60664-4\u3054\u4f7f\u7528\u8005 \u5927\u8c9d \u6075\u5b50 (TOTO\u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e)JSA Web Store order No.910013262 / Downloaded:2010-08-26\u300c\u30e6\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u30e9\u30a4\u30bb\u30f3\u30b9\u5951\u7d04\u300d\u306b\u5f93\u3063\u3066\u3054\u4f7f\u7528\u304f\u3060\u3055\u3044\u3002Table 16 orimpulse voltage test (Clause 14)IEC 992/10ClearanceFigure L.1 \u2013 Sequence for the determination of  clearances\u2013 134 \u2013 60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010When measuring creepage distances, the following applies.The working voltage, pollution degree and material group are determined.The creepage distances of basic insulation and supplementary insulation are measured and compared with the minimum values specified in Table 17 or Table 2 in IEC 60664-4 as appropriate. A particular creepage distance is then compared with the corresponding clearance of Table 16 and enlarged if necessary in order not to be less than the clearance. For pollution degree 1, the reduced clearance based on the impulse voltage test can be used. However, the creepage distance can not be less than the values of Table 17.The creepage distances of functional insulation are measured and compared with the minimum values specified in Table 18 or for periodic working voltages exceeding 30 kHz Table 2 of IEC 60664-4.The creepage distances of reinforced insulation are measured and compared with twice the minimum values specified in Table 17.NOTE The sequence for determining creepage distances is shown in Figure L.2.60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010 \u2013 135 \u2013Working voltageMaterial groupPollution degreeBasic insulation (Table 17 or Table 2 in IEC 60664-4as applicable)Supplementary insulation(as obtained for basic insulation from  Table 17 or Table 2 inIEC 60664-4 asapplicable)Functional insulation (larger of Table 18 or for periodic working voltages > 30 kHz in  Table 2 ofIEC 60664-4)Reinforced insulation (29.2.3)Impulse voltage test on clearanceClearancefrom Table 16Pollution degree 2, 3Pollution degree 1Clearancefrom Table 16Creepage distanceFigure L.2 \u2013 Sequence for the determination of creepage distancesIEC 561/01\u2013 136 \u2013 60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010Annex M(normative)Pollution degreeThe following information on pollution degrees is extracted from IEC 60664-1.PollutionThe microenvironment determines the effect of pollution on the insulation. The macro- environment, however, has to be taken into account when considering the microenvironment.Means may be provided to reduce pollution at the insulation under consideration by effective use of enclosures, encapsulation or hermetic sealing. Such means to reduce pollution may not be effective when the equipment is subjected to condensation or if in normal use, it generates pollutants itself.Small clearances can be bridged completely by solid particles, dust and water and therefore minimum clearances are specified where pollution may be present in the microenvironment.NOTE 1 Pollution will become conductive in the presence of humidity. Pollution caused by contaminated water, soot, metal or carbon dust is inherently conductive.NOTE 2 Conductive pollution by ionized gases and metallic depositions occur only in specific instances, for example in arc chambers of switchgear or controlgear and is not covered by IEC 60664-1.Degrees of pollution in the microenvironmentFor the purpose of evaluating creepage distances, the following four degrees of pollution in the microenvironment are established:pollution degree 1: no pollution or only dry, non-conductive pollution occurs. The pollution has no influence;pollution degree 2: only non-conductive pollution occurs, except that occasionally a temporary conductivity caused by condensation is to be expected;pollution degree 3: conductive pollution occurs or dry non-conductive pollution occurs that becomes conductive due to condensation that is to be expected;pollution degree 4: the pollution generates persistent conductivity caused by conductive dust or by rain or snow.NOTE 3 Pollution degree 4 is not applicable to appliances.60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010 \u2013 137 \u2013Annex N(normative)Proof tracking testThe proof tracking test is carried out in accordance with IEC 60112 with the following modifications.7 Test apparatus7.3 Test solutionsTest solution A is used.Determination of proof tracking index (PTI)ProcedureModification:The proof voltage is 100 V, 175 V, 400 V or 600 V, as appropriate.

Overvoltage category is a numeral defining a transient overvoltage condition.Equipment of overvoltage category IV is for use at the origin of the installation.NOTE 1 Examples of such equipment are electricity meters and primary overcurrent protection equipment.Equipment of overvoltage category III is equipment in fixed installations and for cases where the reliability and the availability of the equipment is subject to special requirements.NOTE 2 Examples of such equipment are switches in the fixed installation and equipment for industrial use with permanent connection to the fixed installation.Equipment of overvoltage category II is energy consuming equipment to be supplied from the fixed installation.NOTE 3 Examples of such equipment are appliances, portable tools and other household and similar loads.If such equipment  is subjected  to special requirements with regard  to reliability and availability, overvoltage category III applies.Equipment of overvoltage category I is equipment for connection to circuits in which measures are taken to limit transient overvoltages to an appropriately low level.\u2013 132 \u2013 60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010Annex L(informative)Guidance for the measurement of clearances and creepage  distancesWhen measuring clearances, the following applies.The rated voltage and overvoltage category are determined (see Annex K).NOTE 1 In general, appliances are in overvoltage category II.The rated impulse voltage is determined from Table 15.If pollution degree 3 is applicable, or if the appliance is class 0 or class 01, the clearances for basic insulation and functional insulation are measured and compared with the minimum values specified in Table 16. For other cases, the impulse voltage test may be carried out if the rigidity requirements of 29.1 are met, otherwise the values specified in Table 16 apply. However, for functional insulation that is subjected to a steady-state voltage or recurring peak voltage with a frequency not exceeding 30 kHz, the clearances are also obtained from Table F.7a in IEC 60664-1 or if the frequency exceeds 30 kHz, Clause 4 in IEC 60664-4. The larger of the values so obtained is applied if they exceed the minimum values specified in Table 16.Clearances of supplementary insulation and reinforced insulation are measured and compared with the minimum values specified in Table 16.NOTE 2 Special considerations apply for clearances subjected to higher working voltages than rated voltage.

A particular creepage distance is then compared with the corresponding clearance of Table 16 and enlarged if necessary in order not to be less than the clearance. For pollution degree 1, the reduced clearance based on the impulse voltage test can be used. However, the creepage distance can not be less than the values of Table 17.The creepage distances of functional insulation are measured and compared with the minimum values specified in Table 18 or for periodic working voltages exceeding 30 kHz Table 2 of IEC 60664-4.The creepage distances of reinforced insulation are measured and compared with twice the minimum values specified in Table 17.NOTE The sequence for determining creepage distances is shown in Figure L.2.60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010 \u2013 135 \u2013Working voltageMaterial groupPollution degreeBasic insulation (Table 17 or Table 2 in IEC 60664-4as applicable)Supplementary insulation(as obtained for basic insulation from  Table 17 or Table 2 inIEC 60664-4 asapplicable)Functional insulation (larger of Table 18 or for periodic working voltages > 30 kHz in  Table 2 ofIEC 60664-4)Reinforced insulation (29.2.3)Impulse voltage test on clearanceClearancefrom Table 16Pollution degree 2, 3Pollution degree 1Clearancefrom Table 16Creepage distanceFigure L.2 \u2013 Sequence for the determination of creepage distancesIEC 561/01\u2013 136 \u2013 60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010Annex M(normative)Pollution degreeThe following information on pollution degrees is extracted from IEC 60664-1.PollutionThe microenvironment determines the effect of pollution on the insulation. The macro- environment, however, has to be taken into account when considering the microenvironment.Means may be provided to reduce pollution at the insulation under consideration by effective use of enclosures, encapsulation or hermetic sealing. Such means to reduce pollution may not be effective when the equipment is subjected to condensation or if in normal use, it generates pollutants itself.Small clearances can be bridged completely by solid particles, dust and water and therefore minimum clearances are specified where pollution may be present in the microenvironment.NOTE 1 Pollution will become conductive in the presence of humidity. Pollution caused by contaminated water, soot, metal or carbon dust is inherently conductive.NOTE 2 Conductive pollution by ionized gases and metallic depositions occur only in specific instances, for example in arc chambers of switchgear or controlgear and is not covered by IEC 60664-1.Degrees of pollution in the microenvironmentFor the purpose of evaluating creepage distances, the following four degrees of pollution in the microenvironment are established:pollution degree 1: no pollution or only dry, non-conductive pollution occurs. The pollution has no influence;pollution degree 2: only non-conductive pollution occurs, except that occasionally a temporary conductivity caused by condensation is to be expected;pollution degree 3: conductive pollution occurs or dry non-conductive pollution occurs that becomes conductive due to condensation that is to be expected;pollution degree 4: the pollution generates persistent conductivity caused by conductive dust or by rain or snow.NOTE 3 Pollution degree 4 is not applicable to appliances.60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010 \u2013 137 \u2013Annex N(normative)Proof tracking testThe proof tracking test is carried out in accordance with IEC 60112 with the following modifications.7 Test apparatus7.3 Test solutionsTest solution A is used.Determination of proof tracking index (PTI)ProcedureModification:The proof voltage is 100 V, 175 V, 400 V or 600 V, as appropriate.

effect of pollution on the insulation. The macro- environment, however, has to be taken into account when considering the microenvironment.Means may be provided to reduce pollution at the insulation under consideration by effective use of enclosures, encapsulation or hermetic sealing. Such means to reduce pollution may not be effective when the equipment is subjected to condensation or if in normal use, it generates pollutants itself.Small clearances can be bridged completely by solid particles, dust and water and therefore minimum clearances are specified where pollution may be present in the microenvironment.NOTE 1 Pollution will become conductive in the presence of humidity. Pollution caused by contaminated water, soot, metal or carbon dust is inherently conductive.NOTE 2 Conductive pollution by ionized gases and metallic depositions occur only in specific instances, for example in arc chambers of switchgear or controlgear and is not covered by IEC 60664-1.Degrees of pollution in the microenvironmentFor the purpose of evaluating creepage distances, the following four degrees of pollution in the microenvironment are established:pollution degree 1: no pollution or only dry, non-conductive pollution occurs. The pollution has no influence;pollution degree 2: only non-conductive pollution occurs, except that occasionally a temporary conductivity caused by condensation is to be expected;pollution degree 3: conductive pollution occurs or dry non-conductive pollution occurs that becomes conductive due to condensation that is to be expected;pollution degree 4: the pollution generates persistent conductivity caused by conductive dust or by rain or snow.NOTE 3 Pollution degree 4 is not applicable to appliances.60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010 \u2013 137 \u2013", "The proof tracking test is carried out in accordance with IEC 60112 with the following modifications.7 Test apparatus7.3 Test solutionsTest solution A is used.Determination of proof tracking index (PTI)ProcedureModification:The proof voltage is 100 V, 175 V, 400 V or 600 V, as appropriate.

Measurements are to be made with the thermostat, if any, open and closed. Upon evidence of stabilizing readings, monitoring periods may be increased.d) If the product employs a single pole switch or a thermostat with an off position, monitoring of leakage current is to continue until the leakage current stabilizes or decreases after the product is turned off.

Sufficient samples of the product shall be provided to conduct all of the tests required. Products may be tested as a complete assembly or the separate components or sub-assemblies may be tested individually. For test results from components or sub-assemblies to be acceptable, the sum of the tested exposures shall be equal to or greater than the actual exposures of the complete assembly, except for the growth of micro-organisms test, where the tested exposure shall be in the range of 1000 mm 2 /L to 15 000 mm 2 /L. NOTE: Care should be taken in considering the approval of materials that are not in final product form. The performance of materials is affected by the processing conditions, which may influence results of the tests described in this Standard. Any changes in the material formulation, the process of manufacture, the method of application, or the surface area-to-volume ratio in end use could affect the suitability of the product for use in contact with drinking water and re-testing may be required. 4.2 Range of product sizes Where a manufacturer produces a complete range of product sizes of the same material composition, tests on the greatest surface area-to-volume ratio product shall qualify the remainder of the range, provided that the same manufacturing conditions and processes are used for the complete range of products. 4.3   Product exposure Wherever possible, samples of the product shall be tested by in-the-product exposure (see Paragraph A4.1), so that only the surface that is normally wetted in end use is exposed to the test water. Where in-the-product exposure is not possible, or where unfabricated material is being tested, the product surface or a representative sample of the material surface shall be tested by immersion exposure (see Paragraph A4.2). The ratio of exposed surface area to extractant water volume for immersion exposure testing shall be equal to (within 5%) or greater than the surface area-to-volume ratio in the intended end use, and shall not be less than 1000 mm2 /L. Where testing for the growth of micro-organisms, the ratio shall be in the range 22 21000 mm /L to 15 000 mm /L. Where the end-use exposure is greater than 15 000 mm /L, the test result shall be based on a testing exposure of 15 000 mm 2 /L and no scaling factor shall be applied to this result. Where a product has multiple non-metallic components, the non-metallic wetted components shall be tested at the end-use exposure, with the exception that end-of-line fittings shall be tested at an exposure for each component in contact with 250 mL of water. The MDOD result shall be the average of results for individual components.", "5.1   General Scaling factors are normally specified in the relevant product Standard. The discussion below applies to situations in which this is not the case. Flexible hoses are tested as end-of-line fittings unless otherwise specified in the relevant product Standard. A scaling factor is generally not applicable to in-the-product testing (e.g. the testing of pipe). In this method of exposure, the ratio of the exposed surface area to the extractant water volume will in most cases be equal to the surface area-to-volume ratio in end use (i.e. a scaling factor of 1). An exception applies in certain cases of in-the-product testing, where in end use the internal surface of the product is effectively in contact with a substantially larger volume of water than in the test. Examples of such products are valves and fittings connected into water supply pipelines. A further exception applies in the testing of end-of-line-fittings such as taps and their components, where in the end-use situation the extract contained in the fitting is effectively diluted before consumption. Similarly, the use of a composite extract in the metals extraction test for end-of-line fittings has the effect of providing an inbuilt scaling factor. In immersion exposure testing, the selected surface-area-to-volume ratio in the test can be greater than in the intended end use. Where this is the case, a scaling factor having a value of less than 1 may be applied in the evaluation of the test result. For end-of-line fittings requiring the total immersion procedure, the fitting is tested in 250 mL of test water. In addition, the testing exposure shall be not less than 1000 mm 2 /L. Scaling factors cannot be applied to qualify products for end-use surface area-to-volume ratios higher than the test ratio, i.e. the scaling factor cannot be greater than 1. Scaling factors can be used only to qualify products for use at surface area-to-volume ratios lower than the test ratio. 5.2   Determination of scaling factors Where a scaling factor is applied in either immersion exposure testing or in-the-product testing, the value of this scaling factor will have been agreed between the manufacturer and the testing laboratory. Where product certification is required, the agreed scaling factor needs to be acceptable to the certifying body. The scaling factor specified shall be in the range 0.01 to 1.0 and shall apply to all tests. The test report shall include the value and method of derivation of the scaling factor. NOTE: Examples of the method of scaling factor calculation in some typical product applications are given in Appendix B.  In the case of domestic plumbing fittings, a scaling factor based on the layout in Figure B1 will apply, unless the manufacturer presents another valid approach. 5.3 Application of scaling factors (see Paragraph B3 Example 1) The scaling factor shall be applied by sample size selection (to produce the surface area-tovolume ratio applicable to the end-use situation) and/or by the application of the scaling factor to each test. Where used for a test, the scaling factor shall be applied as follows: (a) Taste The extract is diluted with fresh extractant water in proportion to the scaling factor. (b) Appearance The extract is diluted in proportion to the scaling factor or, alternatively, the concentration of each colour and/or turbidity value in the extract is multiplied by the scaling factor. (c) Growth of micro-organisms The mean dissolved oxygen difference is multiplied by the scaling factor. (d) Cytotoxic and mutagenic activity The extract is diluted with fresh extractant water in proportion to the scaling factor. (e) Extraction of metals The extract is diluted with fresh extractant water in proportion to the scaling factor or, alternatively, the concentration of each metal in the extract is multiplied by the scaling factor. 5.4 Restrictions on the use of scaling factors The uncertainty of measurement in laboratory testing will increase as the amount of dilution of the extract increases. As a practical limit, the maximum allowable dilution of the extract prior to assessment for taste, appearance, cytotoxic and mutagenic activity, and extraction of metals (Appendices C, D, F, G and H) shall not exceed 1 part extract to 99 parts fresh extractant water. Similarly, a scaling factor applied to the test result in the appearance test (see Clause 5.3(b)) or the extraction of metals test (see Clause 5.3(e)) shall not have a value of less than 0.01. In the growth of micro-organisms test (see Clause 5.3(c)), the scaling factor applied to the test result shall not have a value of less than 0.33. NOTE: Where a scaling factor of less than 0.33 is required for the growth of micro-organisms test, adjustment of the surface area-to-volume ratio is necessary prior to testing.", "6.1   General Products for use in contact with drinking water shall be subjected to tests for taste, appearance, growth of aquatic micro-organisms, cytotoxicity, mutagenicity and extraction of metals, dependent on whether the type of product is in-line, end-of-line or hot water system, in accordance with Table 1 and the methods given in Appendices C to K, as appropriate. The results of these tests shall comply with the criteria set out below. Testing shall be undertaken unless specifically excluded by the relevant product standard. NOTE: As experience in the use of this Standard increases, a list of products exempt from testing may be developed. NOTES: 1 \u2018Metallic pipes and fittings\u2019 are defined as those products that contain only wetted metallic components as part of the complete assembly. 2 The microbial test is undertaken for products that contain non-metallic wetted components. Testing of the products is usually conducted at 30\u00b0C and covers products that operate at less than 40\u00b0C (see Appendix E). 3 N/A: Test is not required. 6.2 Taste of water extract When the product is tested in accordance with Appendix C, if a reportable taste is detected by any member of the taste panel in the first dilution of the first and/or seventh chlorinated or unchlorinated extract, the product shall be deemed unsuitable for contact with drinking water unless two further samples are examined and each panellist reports no taste in the first dilution of the final (i.e. seventh) chlorinated or unchlorinated extract from these samples. 6.3   Appearance of water extract When the product is tested in accordance with Appendix D, the increase in true colour and turbidity of the water in the first extract shall be less than five Hazen Units (HU) and 0.5 Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTU) respectively. If a single sample does not comply with this requirement after a seventh extract, the product shall be deemed unsuitable for contact with drinking water unless three further samples are examined and the mean colour and turbidity of their final (i.e. seventh) extracts are not increased by more than 5 HU or 0.5 NTU respectively. 6.4   Growth of aquatic micro-organisms When the product is tested in accordance with Appendix E, the mean dissolved oxygen difference (MDOD) shall be less than or equal to 2.4 mg/L. If a single sample of a product gives an MDOD in the range 1.7 mg/L to 2.9 mg/L inclusive, two further samples of the product shall be examined. If the arithmetic mean of the three MDOD values is greater than 2.4 mg/L, the product shall be deemed unsuitable for contact with drinking water. 6.5 Cytotoxic activity of water extract When the product is tested in accordance with Appendix F, the extract shall not cause a cytotoxic response. If a single sample gives a cytotoxic response, two further samples of the product shall be examined using fresh reagents. 6.6   Mutagenic activity of water extract The product shall be tested in accordance with Appendix G and the test result shall be reported. If a single sample gives a statistically significant result, two further samples shall be extracted using fresh reagents and the reversion test repeated with the same strain of bacterium. A positive result shall be confirmed by testing for mutagenicity of the extract using the alternative micro-organism test system. NOTE: The reliability of the test for mutagenic activity is currently under investigation. Whereas there is still a requirement to report the result of this test, that test result should not at this time form the basis for overall failure of the sample. 6.7   Extraction of metals 6.7.1 Products in general When the product is tested in accordance with Appendices H to J, the amounts of the specified metals in the first and/or final extracts shall not exceed the limits given in Table 2. NOTE: The limits give in Table 2 are subject to adjustment from time to time. The latest available concentrations should be obtained from the Australian Drinking Water Guidelines (ADWG) and the Drinking Water Standards for New Zealand (DWSNZ). If the limit for any metal is exceeded in the final (seventh) extract from any of the duplicate samples, the product shall be deemed unsuitable for contact with drinking water unless a further three samples are examined and the mean of the specified metals in their final seventh extracts does not exceed the limits specified in Table 2. Where the product tested is applied to a metal fitting, the assessment shall be made on the differences in concentrations of the specified metals between the final extracts and the metal-fitting blank test. Where a cementitious product has been tested, the assessment shall be made on the differences in concentrations of the specified metals between the final extracts and the reagent blank test. 6.7.2 End-of-line fittings A procedure for testing end-of-line fittings for extraction of metals is given in Appendix I. If either of the duplicate samples exceeds the concentration limits specified in Table 2, a further three fresh samples of the product shall be examined. The product shall be deemed to pass the test if the mean of the specified metals for all samples does not exceed the limits given in Table 2.", "Where products are designed for use in hot water installations and the water in contact with the product surfaces meets the definition given in Clause 3.5, products shall be tested in accordance with Appendix J or K. The manufacturer of the product is responsible for nominating the maximum holding temperature of the water contained in the product, within the range 40\u00b0C to 100\u00b0C inclusive. For end-of-line fittings used in cold and hot water applications, a maximum temperature shall be used for test extractions in accordance with Appendix I. Products that pass the tests required in Appendix I, J or K meet the requirements for hot water exposure up to the temperature used in testing. Products that pass these tests shall also be deemed to comply with the cold water requirements for all tests undertaken as part of the hot water testing program.

The method is applicable to all types of product used in contact with drinking water.C2 INTRODUCTIONLicensed to Mr LIM YH on 4 December 2009. 1 user personal user licence only. Storage, distribution or use on network prohibited (10074895).WARNING: CONDUCT THIS TEST WITH DUE REGARD TO THE POSSIBLE PRESENCE IN THE EXTRACTS OF SUBSTANCES THAT MAY BE HAZARDOUS  TO THE HEALTH OF THE TASTE PANELLISTS.  ONLY PRODUCTS FOUND TO BE SATISFACTORY IN THE MICROBIOLOGICAL GROWTH TEST (SEE APPENDIX E), THE ORGANIC SUBSTANCES TESTS (SEE APPENDICES F AND G) AND THE METALS EXTRACTION TESTS (SEE APPENDICES  H AND I) MAY BE ASSESSED IN THIS TEST, UNLESS DETAILS OF THE CHEMICAL COMPOSITION AND PROCESS OF MANUFACTURE OF THE SAMPLES ARE KNOWN AND ANY POSSIBLE HAZARD CAN BE ASSESSED.Some materials are capable of leaching into water compounds, giving rise to unacceptable tastes at very low concentrations.All taste assessment procedures are subjective and fall into the following two basic types:(a) Those that involve the tasting of a water sample and its qualitative classification on the basis of the intensity and nature of the taste.(b) Those in which a semi-quantitative determination of taste intensity is made by a group of people who assess a series of dilutions of the sample.The method described in this Appendix involves a combination of these procedures.NOTE: Experience gained from the assessment of a wide variety of different materials indicates that odours are not encountered in the absence of a discernible taste. It is for this reason that this method is concerned with taste alone.C3 PRINCIPLEA sample of the product is exposed to chlorine-free test water for 24 h and the extract is then diluted and assessed by a taste panel. If any panellist reports a taste in the first dilution, the same samples are exposed to the test water for a further six sequential periods, including one 72 h period and concluding with a 24 h period, fresh chlorine-free test water being used for each period. The water from the seventh exposure period is diluted and then assessed by a taste panel. The test procedure is also carried out using chlorinated test water.C4 TEST PREMISESThe assessment of taste shall be performed in a room that is free from obtrusive draughts and noise and has a general environment that allows the panellists to perform their task unobserved. No air fresheners or room deodorizers shall be used in the room, which shall be sited away from any activity that could generate interfering odours. The temperature of the room shall be (21 \u00b14)\u00b0C.C5 REAGENTS", "TEST METHOD\u2014APPEARANCE OF WATER EXTRACT(Normative)D1 SCOPEThis Appendix sets out a method for assessing the ability of a product to impart a noticeable colour or turbidity to drinking water.

STANDARD MICROBIOLOGICAL PROCEDURES SHOULD BE FOLLOWED THROUGHOUT.Materials containing organic substances (as ingredients, contaminants or process by- products) that are capable of being utilized by micro-organisms can give rise to a noticeable deterioration in the quality of the water with which they are in contact. This deterioration may manifest itself as a change in the organoleptic, physical or microbiological characteristics of water. Microbial growth may occur in the water or at the material-water interface. The phenomenon is distinct from that of microbial attachment, which can occur on the surface of any type of material. If utilizable substances leach out of the material into the water, the growth will be self-limiting and decline in proportion to the rate of leaching. Growths on such materials have been found to persist for periods from 18 months to three years. Where the utilizable substance is bound within or to the material, growths can persist indefinitely.Materials capable of supporting microbial growth do not give rise to an observable deterioration in water quality in every situation. This is due to the influence of various environmental factors, particularly temperature and the presence of residual chlorine. However, in plumbing systems the water temperature is rarely low enough to inhibit microbial growth, and the low level of residual chlorine present in public water supplies will not exert any appreciable bacteriocidal or bacteriostatic action once the water is within the customer\u2019s piping.Drinking water has been treated to ensure the absence of pathogens that give rise to enteric disease, but it is not sterile. The numbers and types of harmless micro-organisms present in drinking water vary considerably, and the natural flora comprise many strains that are adapted to living in a relatively hostile environment. Such organisms differ in their physiological capacity from strains of the same organism found in other environments or grown in the laboratory. Tests using natural strains of aquatic organisms have given responses that correlate well with the occurrence of problems in practice, whereas the responses of laboratory cultures have not given reliable predictions of the performance of a material in practice.There is no technique, based on growing micro-organisms on or in culture media, that enumerates all the aquatic micro-organisms present in a sample of water. Thus the overall number of micro-organisms can be assessed only by an indirect measurement of their activity. The method of assessing microbial activity in the test system described in this Appendix is the measurement of dissolved oxygen uptake. The organisms that give rise to appreciable microbial growth respire aerobically and exert an influence on the levels of oxygen dissolved in the water in the test systems.", "TEST METHOD\u2014CYTOTOXIC ACTIVITY OF WATER EXTRACT(Normative)F1 SCOPEThis Appendix sets out qualitative and quantitative methods for cytotoxicity testing of all products used in contact with drinking water.F2 PRINCIPLEF2.1 GeneralLicensed to Mr LIM YH on 4 December 2009. 1 user personal user licence only. Storage, distribution or use on network prohibited (10074895).A sample of the product is exposed to test water for 24 h. The exposures are repeated using fresh water for one further 48-hour period, followed by one 72-hour period.An aliquot from each product extract is used in the preparation of a nutrient medium for the growth of mammalian cells.Blank extracts, negative and positive controls are assessed in parallel with the sample extracts. Assessment of cytotoxicity is achieved by comparing identical time points of the product extracts with their relative blanks. Alternatively, evidence of a cytotoxic response is determined when the morphology of the cell line is affected by the sample extracts.F2.2 Qualitative determination of cytotoxicity by microscopyThe morphology of cells grown in the presence of the product extracts is observed and compared to those of the blank extracts.F2.3 Quantitative determination of cytotoxicity by endpoint assayCytotoxicity can be determined quantitatively by measuring cell viability via an endpoint assay. The use of 1-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-3,5-diphenylformazan (MTT) is one such example. In the presence of active cellular mitochondrial reductases, MTT is reduced from the soluble yellow tetrazolium salt into insoluble purple formazan crystals. Dissolving the cells and crystals in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) creates a homogeneous solution, the absorbance of which is measured at 570 nm (reference at 630 nm). Absorbance is directly proportional to cell viability. The cytotoxicity of the extracts is quantified using a cytotoxicity standard curve and quality control standards. These are included to ensure correct performance of the assay.F3 TEST PREMISESBoth procedures shall be carried out only by persons having experience in tissue culture and microscopic examination of cell morphology.NOTES:1 The test should be carried out in a suitable biohazard cabinet.2 The nutrient media used in this test are capable of supporting microbial growth and the cell line is capable of being infected by human viruses.WARNING: AS WELL AS OBSERVING SAFE WORKING PRACTICES, PARTICULAR CARE IS NECESSARY IN HANDLING CONTINUOUS CELL LINES BECAUSE THEY MAY BECOME INFECTED WITH PATHOGENIC VIRUSES AND BACTERIA DURING THE COURSE OF THEIR MANIPULATION.F4 REAGENTS", "TEST METHOD\u2014MUTAGENIC ACTIVITY OF WATER EXTRACT(Normative)G1 SCOPEThis Appendix sets out a method for bacterial mutagenicity testing of leachates from all products used in contact with drinking water.G2 PRINCIPLELicensed to Mr LIM YH on 4 December 2009. 1 user personal user licence only. Storage, distribution or use on network prohibited (10074895).The Ames test is a reverse mutation assay using Salmonella typhimurium. An alternative system uses Escherichia coli. The assay uses a pre-incubation plate incorporation method. A reverse-mutation assay detects mutation in a gene of an amino acid-requiring bacterial strain, the result of which is to produce an amino acid-independent strain. This assay is based on OECD Guidelines 471 and 472 and the Ames test as reviewed by Maron and Ames (1983).*The Salmonella typhimurium histidine (His) reversion system is a microbial assay, which\u2212measures His+to Hisreversion induced by chemicals that cause base changes or frameshiftmutations in the genome of this organism.The Escherichia coli tryptophan (Trp) reversion system is a microbial assay, which\u2212measures Trp+to Trpreversion induced by chemicals that cause mutations in the genomeof this organism.The assay used incorporates a pre-incubation step in which the bacteria are exposed to the test substance with a metabolic activation system prior to addition of top agar and overlaying onto a defined minimal medium agar plate. The assay also uses a direct addition to the top agar overlay where no metabolic activation is attempted. After a suitable period of incubation, revertant colonies are counted and compared with the number of spontaneous revertants in a blank extract control culture. For the purposes of this Standard, separate tests with one of the two systems are used to determine the absence of substances that give rise to a mutagenic response. If a mutagenic response is detected in one system of reverse- mutation assay, confirmation in the other system is required (i.e. if an extract is mutagenic using the Salmonella typhimurium system, mutagenicity is confirmed using a suitable Escherichia coli system and vice versa).G3 TEST PREMISESCultures and media shall be manipulated in a laboratory having a biologically clean atmosphere that is dust free, and the test shall be carried out in an environment that avoids contamination of the bacteria culture. The testing should be carried out in a suitable biohazard cabinet conforming with AS 2567 where appropriate.G4 REAGENTSG4.1 Test waterPrepared as described in Paragraph C5.1.1 except for the testing of cementitious products (see Paragraph A8).* MARON, D.M. and AMES, B.N. \u2018Revised methods for the Salmonella mutagenicity test\u2019.

Where the fitting is in contact with cold and hot water, the method takes into account hot and cold cycles and the transient nature of water temperature. It also uses a scaling factor of less than 1, as the extract contained in the fitting is in practice dispersed into a larger total volume of water when the water is consumed.Licensed to Mr LIM YH on 4 December 2009. 1 user personal user licence only. Storage, distribution or use on network prohibited (10074895).The test for growth of aquatic micro-organisms is undertaken using the extraction procedures described in Appendix E.For methods of analysis of the extracts, refer to the appropriate appendices.I2 PRINCIPLEIn-the-product exposure is used wherever possible for the test extractions (A4.1), so that the sample of the fitting is completely filled with the test water (extractant water) to cover the surface area-to-volume ratio in end use. For Appendices C, D, F and G, at the completion of the appropriate contact period, which may include an initial maximum temperature exposure (for fittings used for the distribution of water that is \u226540\u00b0C), the volume held in the test fitting is collected, and made up to a final volume of 250 mL prior to analysis.Immersion exposure (A4.2) is used for fittings such as tap components that cannot be evaluated by in-the-product exposure and can be installed within 250 mL draw-off of adrinking water delivery point. In such cases, the test fitting is totally immersed in 250 mL2of extractant water at not less than 1000 mm /L test water.Immersion exposure applies also for extraction of metals (see Appendix H) in cases where fittings and components cannot be tested for metals using the test rig (I3.1).The test rig is used to test for extraction of metals (see Appendix H) in end-of-line fittings.The test rig comprises a suitable water storage container and heater (hot tests) connected via a pipe to an isolation valve, which is then connected via a pipe to the test fitting. The extractant water is brought into contact with the fitting materials up to the closing mechanism or, if this does not exist, the outlet end of the fitting, for an extended contact period. This period simulates overnight contact of water with an end-of-line fitting in a domestic situation. After the contact period, aliquots of water are drawn from the fitting over a 3.5 h period and the aliquots combined and tested as a composite test extract for the relevant metals (see Table 2).I3 APPARATUSI3.1 Test rig (for test procedure I6.3)The test rig is constructed of materials shown not to leach materials into the water. The test rig comprises a water storage vessel suitable for containing at least 15 L of extractant water and a connecting valve and pipe. For testing end-of-line fittings for the hot water tests, a suitable method of heating the test water shall be used. A commercial urn, shown not to influence any results, can be used for this purpose.The storage container is connected via a DN 25 diameter fitting to an isolating valve adjacent to the container and then via a DN 25 diameter PE, PP or PB pipe to a threaded junction for the test fitting. The volume contained in the pipe between the isolating valve and the entry to the fitting shall be (350 \u00b110) mL.", "HIGH TEMPERATURE TESTS(Normative)J1 SCOPELicensed to Mr LIM YH on 4 December 2009. 1 user personal user licence only. Storage, distribution or use on network prohibited (10074895).Products used in contact with hot water can leach water-soluble compounds not detectable in significant quantities when extracted and tested under conditions specified elsewhere in this Standard for cold water applications. Such products, if found to be satisfactory by the other tests described in this Standard, can be tested by the method described in this Appendix if they are intended for use in hot water installations and the water in contact with the product will pass to a draw-off point from which the water is intended for drinking purposes.This Appendix describes the extraction procedure to be used in assessing the ability of a product to impart a discernible taste or any noticeable colour or turbidity to hot water intended for drinking. It is also applicable in assessing the leaching of metals from products in hot water and the extraction from such products of substances that may be of concern to public health. It is not applicable to the test for growth of aquatic micro-organisms (see Appendix E), except where the product is to be used for cold and hot water applications. In such cases, the test for growth of aquatic micro-organisms is undertaken at 30\u00b0C for cold and hot water tests, using the extraction procedures in Appendix E.

For total immersion, the product and test water are held in a suitable container, as in Paragraph A2.3, at the maximum holding water temperature. Extraction is allowed to proceed for the time given in the relevant test.

This may be due to variations in the configurations of the EUT in practice, physical or practical limitations. Examples of these arrangements include:\u2022 wall, ceiling or rack mounted,\u2022 handheld,\u2022 body worn.For example, a video projector can be positioned in various ways with respect to walls, ceiling or the floor of a room.

Sufficient details shall be provided to facilitate reproducibility of the measurements. This shall include photographs of the measurement configuration for the formal measurements where this is appropriate.The test report shall state the mode of operation of the EUT and how its ports were exercised (see Annex B).

If another measurement distance is used, the report shall include a description of how the limits were calculated.Further guidance is given in Annex F.", "10 Compliance with this publicationCompliance with this publication requires that the EUT satisfies either the Class A or Class B requirements defined in Annex A, as appropriate. An EUT which fulfils the applicable requirements specified in Annex A is deemed to fulfil the requirements in the entire frequency range from 9 kHz to 400 GHz. No measurements need be performed at frequencies where no requirement is specified.Where this publication gives options for measuring particular requirements with a choice of measurement methods, compliance can be shown against any of the specified limits using the appropriate measurement method. In any situation where it is necessary to re-measure the equipment to show compliance with this publication, the measurement method originally chosen shall be used in order to guarantee consistency of the results, unless it is agreed by the manufacturer to do otherwise. Requirements for radiated emission measurements are defined in Table A.2 to Table A.7 with the restrictions and limitations defined in Table A.1. Requirements for conducted emission measurements are defined in Table A.9 to Table A.13 with the restrictions defined in Table A.8.The determination of compliance with this publication shall be based solely on contributions from the EUT. For example, where an AE is required to exercise or monitor the EUT, and emissions from the AE are known to contribute to the overall measured emission of the system being assessed (for example an AE which is a plug-in module for the EUT), the AE selected should, wherever possible, be compliant with relevant emission limits. If the AE is known to cause significant emissions, these emissions may be reduced by mitigation measures, as long as these measures do not reduce the emissions from the EUT. The preferred configuration is that the AE is removed from the measurement area, as allowed by D.1.Compliance can be shown by measuring the EUT\u2019s emissions when operating its functions simultaneously, individually in turn, or any combination thereof.", "11 Measurement uncertaintyThe measurement instrumentation uncertainty shall  be calculated in accordance  with CISPR 16-4-2 and reported as described in Clause 9.Measurement instrumentation uncertainty shall not be taken into account in the determination of compliance.

The measurement arrangement of the EUT, local AE and associated cabling shall be representative of normal practice.The EUT shall be arranged in accordance with the requirements of Table D.1", "Table D.1 \u2013 Measurement arrangements of  EUTIntended operational arrangement(s) of MMEMeasurement arrangementRemarksTable-top onlyTable-topFloor-standing onlyFloor-standingCan be floor-standing or table- topTable-topRack mountedIn a rack or table-topOther, for example wall mounted, ceiling mounted, handheld, body wornTable-topWith normal orientationIf the equipment is designed to be mounted on a ceiling, the downward-facing portion of the EUT may be oriented facing upward.If a physical hazard would be caused by testing the device on a table top, then it can be arranged as floor standing and the test report shall document the decision and justification.All cables that are considered part of the EUT shall be arranged as for normal use subject to length restrictions given in Table D.2 and subject to the requirement to minimise the size of the arrangement. For example, the keyboard and mouse of a personal computer set-up shall be placed in front of the monitor.The following arrangements may be used to limit the effects of adverse AE emissions or to reduce measurement time, as long as the arrangement can be shown not to reduce the emissions measured from the EUT:\u2022 placing AE below the RGP;\u2022 placing AE below the test volume of a FAR; or,\u2022 placing AE outside the measurement area when it is normally located distant from the EUT.An EUT intended for rack mounting may be arranged in a rack or as table-top equipment. An EUT that can be used in both floor standing and table-top configurations, or both floor standing and wall mounted configurations, shall be assessed in a table-top arrangement. However, if the usual installation is floor standing, then that arrangement shall be used.The type and construction of cables used in the measurement set-up shall be consistent with normal or typical use. Cables with mitigation features (for example, screening, tighter/more twists per length, ferrite beads) shall only be used if it is the intention that all deployments will use these features. If the cable(s) have mitigation features, this detail shall be specified in theCISPR 32:2015 \uf6d9 IEC 2015 \u2013 55 \u2013test report. Manufacturer-supplied or commercially available cabling  shall  be used,  as specified in the installation manual or user manual.Cables connecting to AE located outside the measurement area shall drop directly to, but be insulated from, the RGP (or turntable where applicable), and then be routed directly to the place where they leave the test site. The thickness of the insulation shall not be more than 150 mm. However, cables which would normally be bonded to ground should be bonded to the RGP in accordance with normal practice or the manufacturer\u2019s recommendation.During conducted emission measurements on analogue/digital data ports, the cable between the EUT and the measurement device or probe shall be as short as possible and satisfy the requirements given in Table D.2.Where practical, any excessive length in cables shall be bundled non-inductively, at the mid point between the EUT and the AMN or AAN, for the conducted emission measurement. The bundle length shall be less than 0,4 m to satisfy the distances given in Table D.2.Non-inductive bundling means that the cable is shortened by overlapping loops arranged with alternate end loops wound in opposite directions using the minimum practicable bend radius. Where bundling cannot be achieved, coiling of the cables shall be avoided.The effective length of all loop-back cables not routed overhead shall be longer than 2 m. Where possible, loop-back cables shall be arranged so that outgoing line is not closely coupled to the return.Where possible, the effective length of mains cables shall be 1 m \u00b1 0,1 m.Cable length is the distance between cable connector ends, excluding any protruding pins, when the cable is laid straight. The effective cable length, is the distance between cable connector ends, excluding any protruding pins, when the cable includes one or more bundles. The effective cable length will be shorter than the actual length if the cable has been bundled.Loads and/or devices simulating typical operating conditions shall be connected to at least one of each type of interface port of the EUT. If loading (or terminating) with a device of actual usage is not feasible, the port should preferably be loaded with a simulator. Where these options are not practical the port shall be loaded by the application of a typical impedance considering both the common and differential modes. These loads and/or devices shall be connected via a cable if this represents normal usage.Where there are multiple ports of the same type the manufacturer shall determine whether to load these additional ports, considering:\u2022 maximisation of the emission levels, for example, when adding additional cables does not significantly affect the emission level (for example varies less than 2 dB), it can be assumed a maximum has occurred;\u2022 reproducibility;\u2022 achievement of a representative configuration having regard to other requirements in this clause.For example, additional cables with or without terminations may be connected to the EUT ports. This process may also be applied to establishing the number of similar elements (plug- in modules, internal memory, and so forth) within the EUT.Where the EUT has more than one analogue/digital data port, ports shall be included in the measurement arrangement as follows:\u2022 if there are multiple similar ports on the same card or module type, then it is acceptable to assess one typical port,\u2013 56 \u2013 CISPR 32:2015 \uf6d9 IEC 2015\u2022 where there are ports of the same type on different card or module types, then it is acceptable to assess one typical port on each card or module types.The test report shall identify the ports assessed.An EUT which requires a dedicated ground connection shall be bonded to the RGP or to the chamber wall or chamber floor in case of a FAR, with a grounding connection that is similar to that used in practice.When making measurements in a FAR, any measurements of height are referenced to the bottom of the test volume.NOTE When testing in a FAR, measurements of height are made to the top surface of the turntable or the top of the floor absorber when the floor absorber extends above the turntable.Any antenna masts and supporting floors shall be in place during site validation.

The AMN specification shall be met at the connection point for the EUT (the end of the extension cable or power strip) with at least 0,8 m spacing between the EUT and the connection point on the extension cable.Where the EUT is a collection of equipment with multiple units, each having its own power cable, the point of connection for the AMN is determined by the following rules:\u2022 for an EUT that has several modules, each with its own power cable (however terminated) and for which the manufacturer provides a power strip (multi-socket mains splitter) with a single power cable for connection to the external power source, a single measurement shall be performed at the mains input to that power cable;\u2022 power cables or terminals which are not specified by the manufacturer to be connected via a host unit shall be measured separately;\u2022 power cables or field wiring terminals (mains input terminals) which are specified by the manufacturer to be connected via a host unit or other power-supplying equipment shall be connected as described by the manufacturer;\u2022 where a special connection is specified, the  necessary hardware to effect  the connection shall be supplied by the manufacturer for the purpose of this measurement.In all other cases the conducted emissions on each individual EUT with its own power cable that is terminated in a power supply plug of a standard design (IEC TR 60083 for example) shall be measured separately.Any AAN used during conducted emission measurements shall be selected and configured to be representative of the network in which the EUT is intended to operate. All ports of the AAN shall be correctly terminated in accordance with D.1. Where the 1 m requirement cannot be achieved, because of the position of the power input port/wired network port, then the effective length shall be as short as possible. In the case of EUTs including floor standing equipment the cable connecting the analogue/digital data port to the AAN may be positioned perpendicular to the EUT for a distance between of 0,3 m and 0,8 m then drop vertically to (but be insulated from) the horizontal RGP before being extended to the AAN. In these cases any bundling may be located on (but be insulated from) the ground plane", "D.2.2 Specific conditions for table-top equipmentThe RGP shall have a minimum size of 2 m by 2 m and shall extend a minimum of 0,5 m beyond the EUT, local AE and associated cabling in all directions.Alternative 1: The measurement shall be performed using a vertical RGP.

This configuration should then be used during formal measurements.The number of configurations to be considered is dependent upon the complexity of the EUT. Therefore, a quick and simple procedure should be established for comparative purposes so that the impact of varying the configuration can be found. Changes in configurations which may be considered include:\u2022 mode of operation, as defined in 3.1.23;\u2022 supply voltage discussed in A.1;\u2022 arrangement discussed in Annex D;\u2022 number and arrangement of modules within a system. See Figure 2;\u2022 number of cables attached applying the criteria in D.1.1;\u2022 position of cables, local AE and HID as required in Annex D.The prescan method attempts to closely emulate the formal procedure so that effective comparisons can be achieved. For example, a limited height SAC would be an appropriate prescan facility followed by an OATS/SAC for formal measurements. An effective prescan will give confidence that the configuration which produces the highest amplitude emission with respect to the limit has been found.Prescan measurements may be performed with spectrum analysers without pre-selection provided that precautions are used to ensure that the instrument is not overloaded.A simple procedure to check for overload is to repeat a measurement with an attenuator (for example, 6 dB) added at a convenient point in the measurement path so that the signal present at any active or nonlinear stage of the measurement path (amplifiers, limiters, receivers, and so forth) is reduced by a known amount. If the measured signal level does not decrease by approximately the value  of the attenuator used (within 0,5 dB),  then  the measurement system may be overloaded and steps should be taken to correct the problem.

This standardisation is necessary in order to obtain  reproducible measurement results, independent of the undefined asymmetric common mode impedance at the AE and the EUT.In general, the asymmetric common mode impedance seen by the EUT at the AE port is not defined unless an AAN is used. If the AE is located outside the shielded room, the asymmetric common mode impedance seen by the EUT at the AE port can be determined by the asymmetric common mode impedance of the feed through-filter between the measurement set-up and the outside world. A \u03c0-type filter has a low common mode impedance whilst a T- type filter has a high asymmetric common mode impedance.AANs do not exist for all types of cables used by MME. It is therefore also necessary to define other (non-invasive) measurement procedures that do not use AANs.Normally, there are several other cables (or ports) present at the EUT. At least the connection to the mains port is present in most cases. The asymmetric common mode impedance of these other connections (including a possible ground connection) and the presence or absence of these connections during the measurement can influence the measurement result significantly, particularly for small EUTs. Therefore the asymmetric common mode impedance of the non-measured connections has to be defined during the assessment of small EUTs. It is sufficient to have, in addition to the port being assessed, at  least two additional ports connected to a 150 \u2126 common mode impedance (normally by using an AAN with the RF\u2013 84 \u2013 CISPR 32:2015 \uf6d9 IEC 2015measurement port terminated with 50 \u2126) in order to reduce this influence to a negligible amount.Coupling devices for non-shielded balanced pairs should also simulate the typical LCL value of the lowest cabling category (worst LCL) specified for the wired network port being measured. The idea of this requirement is to take into account the transformation of the symmetrical signal into a asymmetric common mode signal, which might contribute to possible radiated disturbance when the EUT is used in the real application. Asymmetry in the AAN is deliberately introduced to yield the specified LCL value. This asymmetry may enhance or cancel the asymmetry of the EUT. In the interest of determining the worst case emissions and optimization of measurement repeatability, consideration should therefore be given  to repeating the measurement with the LCL imbalance on each wire of a balanced pair when using the appropriate AAN as defined in C.4.1.2.Since imbalance on each balanced pair will contribute to the total conducted common mode emission, all combinations of imbalance on all balanced pairs should be considered. For a single balanced pair, this has a relatively minor measurement impact \u2013 the two wires are reversed. However, for two balanced pairs, the number of LCL loading combinations (and therefore measurement configurations) is four. For four balanced pairs, the number of loading combinations grows to sixteen. Such numbers have a significant impact on measurement time and measurement documentation. Such measurements are not usually implemented, but if carried out the connection to AAN should be carefully documented.The RF measurement port of an AAN not connected to the measuring receiver should be terminated with 50 \u2126.", "Table G.1 \u2013  Summary of advantages and disadvantages of the procedures described in  C.4.1.6ProcedureC.4.1.6.2C.4.1.6.3C.4.1.6.4AdvantagesFor unscreened cablescontaining balanced pairs, theLCL values of the AAN are within the tolerance in Table C.2 of an AAN appropriate to the cablecategory connected to the EUT.

However, unless the asymmetric common mode impedance seenCISPR 32:2015 \uf6d9 IEC 2015 \u2013 85 \u2013by the EUT at the AE connection is 150 \u2126, the procedure in C.4.1.6.4 will show a result which is in general too high, but never too low (worst case estimation of the emission).", "G.2.3 Basic ideas of the CVPThe method described in C.4.1.6.4 uses a CVP to measure the asymmetric common mode voltage. There are two approaches to the construction of a CVP. For either approach, if a 150 \u2126 common mode impedance is present, the capacitance of the CVP to the cable attached to the EUT port being assessed will appear as a load in parallel with the 150 \u2126 common mode impedance.The common mode impedance tolerance is \u00b120 \u2126 over the frequency range of 0,15 MHz to 30 MHz. If the CVP loading is to reduce the 150 \u2126 common mode impedance down to no less than 130 \u2126, the capacitive loading of the CVP to the cable attached to the EUT port being assessed should be \u22645 pF at 30 MHz (the worst case frequency). At 30 MHz, the impedance of 5 pF is approximately 1 061 \u2126, which, in parallel with 150 \u2126 results in a combined common mode impedance of approximately 131,4 \u2126.A first possible CVP construction approach is for the probe to be a single capacitor that relies on physical distance from the cable attached to the EUT port being measured to achieve the <5 pF loading. This style of CVP is described in 5.2.2 of CISPR 16-1-2:2003/ AMD 1:2004/ AMD 2:2006.A second possible construction uses two coupling devices in series. A first capacitive coupling device in close proximity to the cable attached to the EUT port being assessed (the device is actually in physical contact with the insulation of the cable attached to the EUT port being assessed). The second device is a standard oscilloscope-type voltage probe having an impedance >10 M\u2126 with a probe capacitance <5 pF. The theory is that the probe capacitance in series with the capacitance of the capacitive coupling device presents only the probe capacitance to the cable attached to the EUT port being assessed. In practice, it is possible, given the physical size of the capacitive coupling device, to have a large stray capacitance in parallel with the probe capacitance. If this occurs, the total capacitive loading will be greater than that of the probe itself, and the requirement to have <5 pF loading may be violated. If this technique is employed, the capacitive loading should be verified by measurement and not rely on theory. This capacitance measurement can be made with any capacitance meter that can operate over the 0,15 MHz to 30 MHz frequency range. The capacitance is measured between the cable attached to the EUT port being assessed (all wires in the cable are connected together at the connection point to the meter) and the RGP. The same type of cable used in the conducted emissions measurement should be used for this capacitance measurement.NOTE This procedure has the lowest uncertainty if the length of cable between the EUT and AE is less than 1,25 m. Significantly longer cables are subject to standing waves that can adversely affect voltage and current measurements. For long cables where both the voltage and current limits cannot be met, changes to the measurement configuration can be implemented.", "G.2.4 Combination of current and voltage limitIf the common mode impedance is not 150 \u2126, the measurement of the voltage or the current alone is not acceptable because of a very high measurement uncertainty due to the undefined and unknown common mode impedances. If however both voltage and current are measured with current and voltage limits applied simultaneously, the result is a worst case estimation of the emission as explained below. The basic circuit for which the limit is defined is shown in Figure G.12.This circuit is the reference for which current and voltage limits are derived. Any other measurement has to be compared to this basic circuit. Z1 is an unknown parameter of the EUT. Z2 is 150 \u2126 in the reference measurement.\u2013 86 \u2013 CISPR 32:2015 \uf6d9 IEC 2015EUTZ1I Reference measurement with Z2 = 150 \u2126U0                                    U                                  Z2IEC", "Figure G.12 \u2013 Basic circuit for considering the limits with defined common mode impedance of 150 \u2126If the measurement is performed without defining the common mode impedance seen by the EUT, the simplified circuit is as shown in Figure G.12, where the common mode impedance Z2 seen by the EUT is defined by the AE and can have any value. Therefore Z1 as well as Z2 are unknown parameters of the measurement.EUT                                                              AEIZ1U0                                    U                                  Z2IEC", "Figure G.13 \u2013 Basic circuit for the measurement with unknown common mode impedanceIf the measurement is performed according to the circuit of Figure G.12 the limit of current and the limit of voltage are equivalent. The relation between current and voltage are always 150 \u2126 and either of the two can be used to determine the compliance with the limit. This is not the case if Z2 is not 150 \u2126. See Figure G.13.It is important to be aware that the source voltage U0 is not the only quantity determining the compliance with the limit. The disturbance voltage has to be measured at a standardized Z2 of 150 \u2126, while U in Figure G.13 depends on Z1, Z2, and U0 together. The limit value can be reached with an EUT containing a high impedance Z1 and a high source voltage U0, or with a lower U0 combined with a lower impedance Z1.In the more general case of Figure G.13 where Z2 is not defined, it is not possible to measure the exact value of the interference voltage. Since Z1 and U0 are not known, it is not possible to derive the interference voltage, even if the value of Z2 is known (or is measured or calculated from I and U). If for example an EUT, having excessive emissions, is measuredonly by determining the voltage in an arrangement with low Z2 (Z2  <150 \u2126) at the AE side, then the EUT might seem to comply with the limits. By contrast, if the same EUT is measured only by measuring the current in a measurement set-up with high Z2, (for example by addingferrites) the EUT might again seem to comply with the limits.CISPR 32:2015 \uf6d9 IEC 2015 \u2013 87 \u2013However, it can be shown that, if the current limit and the voltage limit are applied simultaneously, an EUT with emissions exceeding the limits is always discovered by exceeding either the current limit (if Z2 is <150 \u2126) or the voltage limit (if Z2 is >150 \u2126).If the common mode impedance of the AE (Z2) is far from 150 \u2126, it is possible that an EUT, which would comply with the limits if measured with Z2 = 150 \u2126, may be rejected. However an EUT not complying with the limits will never be accepted. The measurement according toC.4.1.6.4 is therefore a worst case estimation of the emission. If an EUT exceeds the limit with this procedure, it is possible the EUT would comply with the limits if it could be measuredwith Z2 = 150 \u2126. If emission measurements of the EUT by this procedure were compared to a power limit derived from the voltage and current limits, a more accurate measure of theinterference potential into 150 \u2126 is possible.", "G.2.5 Ferrite requirements for use in C.4.1.1Subclause C.4.1.6.3 defines  a measurement set-up for measuring the  common mode conducted emissions on the shield of a shielded cable. A 150 \u2126 load is specified to be connected between the cable shield and the RGP as described in C.4.1.6.3. Ferrites are shown placed over the cable shield between the 150 \u2126 load and the AE.

The ferrites are specified in C.4.1.6.3 to provide a high impedance such that \u201c\u2026the common mode impedance towards the right of the 150 \u2126 resistor shall be sufficiently large as to not affect the measurement.\u201d This impedance is shown in Figure G.14 as Zferrite in series withZaecm.The above quotation from C.4.1.6.3 infers that the combined series impedance of Zferrite andZaecm should not load down the 150 \u2126 resistor. The general approach in this standard for\u2013 88 \u2013 CISPR 32:2015 \uf6d9 IEC 2015tolerance on 150 \u2126 common mode loads is \u00b1 20 \u2126 over the frequency range of 0,15 MHz to 30 MHz. Combining these two concepts, the combined series impedance of Zferrite and Zaecm in parallel with the 150 \u2126 resistor (Z in Figure G.14) should be no lower than 130 \u2126. This in turn implies that this relationship should hold regardless of the value of Zaecm.This clause provides guidance on the use of ferrites in cause C.4.1.1.To establish the impedance characteristics of the ferrites, only two cases need to be considered: Zaecm = open circuit and Zaecm = short circuit. If the ferrites can be selected to satisfy these requirements, any value of Zaecm will be acceptable.\u2022 Case 1: Zaecm = open circuitThe combined series impedance of Zferrite and Zaecm is also an open circuit. An open circuit in parallel with the 150 \u2126 load is 150 \u2126. Zferrite can be of any value.\u2022 Case 2: Zaecm = short circuitThe combined series impedance of Zferrite and Zaecm is equal to Zferrite. The value of Zferrite in parallel with the 150 \u2126 resistor will then need to be no lower than 130 \u2126. In equation form:[(150)(Zferrite)]/(150 + Zferrite) \u2265 130  \u2126Solving for Zferrite yields a value of 975 \u2126.  This implies that the ferrites selected for this application should have a minimum impedance of 975 \u2126 over the frequency range of0,15 MHz to 30 MHz. For a given set of ferrites, the minimum impedance (j\u03c9L) will occur at the minimum frequency of 0,15 MHz.Combining the two cases cited above, it is seen that Case 2 at 0,15 MHz sets the minimum requirements for the impedance of ferrites so this value (or greater) would be acceptable.To determine whether  the selected ferrites will  accomplish the intended  function, the measurement set-up shown in Figure G.15 is suggested. A traditional impedance meter or analyser can be used to measure the impedance between point Z and the reference ground. Another approach is to measure the individual voltage and current at point Z (I and V in Figure G.15) and calculate the impedance. As a minimum, the impedance measurement should be made at 0,15 MHz. It would be advisable, however, to measure the impedance across the entire 0,15 MHz to 30 MHz range to ensure that no stray capacitance associated with the ferrites and the shielded cable degrades the ferrite impedance. This is of concern since laboratory data have shown that it is unlikely that desired impedance can be achieved with a single pass of the shielded cable through the ferrites. Multiple passes through the ferrites are necessary. This increases chances of stray capacitance adversely affecting the impedance of the ferrites. The capability to achieve the desired impedance versus frequency has been demonstrated in the laboratory.CISPR 32:2015 \uf6d9 IEC 2015 \u2013 89 \u2013Impedance meterCurrent probeCapacitive voltage probeFerritesI ZV150 \u2126Ref.

If the gain of the feed horn is not specified, a standard value of 10 dBi shall be applied.In the rare case of a non-detachable parabolic reflector, the reflector\u2019s gain shall be also added to the limit (or subtracted from the measurement result) for the measurement of the LO emission within \u00b17\u00b0 of the main beam axis (limit in table clause A7.3).", "H.3 Operation conditionsFor the measurement of the LO leakage, the EUT shall be connected to the power supply (via a suitable bias tee) and control signals for switching the LO frequencies, if applicable.For the measurement of spurious radiated emissions, the EUT needs an input signal which can be an un-modulated carrier. Therefore a suitable small transmit antenna shall be placed within the main beam axis of the EUT. The influence of the transmit antenna on the measurement result shall be reduced to a minimum. An example arrangement of the transmit antenna is shown in Figure H.2.The input signal shall be adjusted to get the maximum rated output level from the EUT. For the measurement in the frequency range from 30 MHz to 1 GHz the input signal shall be adjusted so that the output frequency is within this frequency range. For the measurement in the frequency range above 1 GHz, the frequency of the input signal shall be adjusted in such a way that the EUT is measured, as a minimum, at the lowest, middle and highest rated output frequency within the measured frequency range. A typical scenario is as follows:For an LNB with the following characteristics:\u2013 maximum output level: \u201310 dBm,\u2013 LO frequencies: 9,75 GHz and 10,6 GHz,\u2013 output frequency ranges950 MHz to 1 950 MHz (for 9,75 GHz LO)1 100 MHz to 2 150 MHz (for 10,6 GHz LO)the following output frequencies shall be measured with the EUT set to output level of \u2013 10 dBm.\u2013 LO frequency 9,75 GHz: 950 MHz, 1 450 MHz and 1 950 MHz\u2013 LO frequency 10,6 GHz: 1 100 MHz, 1 625 MHz and 2 150 MHz", "H.4 Specific requirements for LO measurementIn the case of a detachable feed horn, the radiated emission of the LO leakage within \u00b17\u00b0 of the main beam axis can be measured directly by a power measurement at the feed horn interface. If a suitable interface (typically types R120, C120) is available, a power meter or spectrum analyzer can be connected to the LNB via a suitable adapter. Due allowance shall be made for the feed losses between the available interface and the antenna flange.\u2013 92 \u2013 CISPR 32:2015 \uf6d9 IEC 2015", "H.5 EUT arrangementsFor the arrangement of the EUT the requirements of Annex D shall be satisfied. The EUT shall be measured as table-top equipment. AE such as the DC source, generator for control signals and measurement device for the output signal shall be placed outside of the measurement area.

It also covers abnormal situations that  can  be expected  in practice  and takes  into account  the way in which electromagnetic phenomena can affect the safe operation of appliances.This standard takes into account the requirements of IEC 60364 as far as possible so that there is compatibility with the wiring rules when the appliance is connected to the supply mains. However, national wiring rules may differ.If the functions of an appliance are covered by different parts 2 of IEC 60335, the relevant part 2 is applied to each function separately, as far as is reasonable. If applicable, the influence of one function on the other is taken into account.NOTE 1 Throughout this publication, when \u201cPart 2\u201d is mentioned, it refers to the relevant part of IEC 60335.When a part 2 standard does not include additional requirements to cover hazards dealt with in Part 1, Part 1 applies.NOTE 2 This means that the technical committees responsible for the part 2 standards have determined that it is not necessary to specify particular requirements for the appliance in question over and above the general requirements.This standard is a product family standard dealing with the safety of appliances and takes precedence over horizontal and generic standards covering the same subject.NOTE 3 Horizontal and generic standards covering a hazard are not applicable since they have been taken into consideration when developing the general and particular requirements for the IEC 60335 series of standards. For example, in the case of temperature requirements for surfaces on many appliances, generic standards, such as ISO 13732-1 for hot surfaces, are not applicable in addition to Part 1 or part 2 standards.Individual countries may wish to consider the application of the standard, as far as is reasonable, to appliances not mentioned in a part 2, and to appliances designed on new principles.An appliance that complies with the text of this standard will not necessarily be considered to comply with the safety principles of the standard if, when examined and tested, it is found to have other features which impair the level of safety covered by these requirements.An appliance employing materials or having forms of construction differing from those detailed in the requirements of this standard may be examined and tested according to the intent of the requirements and, if found to be substantially equivalent, may be considered to comply with the standard.NOTE 4 Standards dealing with non-safety aspects of household appliances areIEC standards published by TC 59 concerning methods of measuring performance;CISPR 11, CISPR 14-1, IEC 61000-3-2 and IEC 61000-3-3 concerning electromagnetic emissions;CISPR 14-2 concerning electromagnetic immunity;IEC standards published by TC 111 concerning environmental matters.60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010 \u2013 9 \u2013HOUSEHOLD AND SIMILAR ELECTRICAL APPLIANCES \u2013 SAFETY  \u2013Part 1: General requirements", "This International Standard deals with the safety of electrical appliances for household and similar purposes, their rated voltage being not more than 250 V for single-phase appliances and 480 V for other appliances.NOTE 1 Battery-operated appliances and other d.c. supplied appliances are within the scope of this standard.Appliances not intended for normal household use but which nevertheless may be a source of danger to the public, such as appliances intended to be used by laymen in shops, in light industry and on farms, are within the scope of this standard.NOTE 2 Examples of such appliances are catering equipment, cleaning appliances for commercial use, and appliances for hairdressers.As far as is practicable, this standard  deals  with the  common hazards  presented by appliances that are encountered by all persons in and around the home.

At this date, the publication will bereconfirmed,withdrawn,replaced by a revised edition, oramended.NOTE 3 The attention of National Committees is drawn to the fact that equipment manufacturers and testing organizations may need a transitional period following publication of a new, amended or revised IEC publication in which to make products in accordance with the new requirements and to equip themselves for conducting new or revised tests.It is the recommendation of the committee that the content of this publication be adopted for implementation nationally not earlier than 12 months or later than 36 months from the date of publication.60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010 \u2013 7 \u2013The following differences exist in the countries indicated below.Introduction: The Part 1 standard (UL60335-1) is only used in combination with a part 2 (UL60335-2-x).National differences are specified in these standards (USA).5.7: The ambient temperature is 25 \u00b0C \u00b1 10 \u00b0C (Japan).5.7: The ambient temperature is 27 \u00b0C \u00b1 5 \u00b0C (India).6.1: Class 0 appliances and class 0I appliances are not allowed (Australia, Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, India, Israel, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Singapore, Slovakia, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom).7.12.2: The requirements for full disconnection do not apply (Japan).13.2: The test circuit and some leakage current limits are different (India).22.2: The second paragraph of this subclause dealing with single-phase class I appliances with heating elements cannot be complied with because of the supply system (France and Norway).22.2: Double-pole switches or protective devices are required (Norway).22.35 Accessible metal parts separated from live parts by earthed metal parts are not regarded as likely to become live in the event of an insulation fault (USA).24.1: IEC component standard requirements are replaced by the relevant requirements of component standards specified in UL60335-1 and parts 2 (UL60335-2-x) (USA).25.3: A set of supply leads is not permitted (Norway, Denmark, Finland, Netherlands).25.8: 0,5 mm2 supply cords are not allowed for class I appliances (Australia and New Zealand).26.6: Conductor cross-sectional areas are different (USA).29.1: Different rated impulse voltages are used between 50 V and 150 V (Japan).\u2013 8 \u2013 60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010INTRODUCTIONIt has been assumed in the drafting of this International Standard that the execution of its provisions is entrusted to appropriately qualified and experienced persons.This standard recognizes the internationally accepted level of protection against hazards such as electrical, mechanical, thermal, fire and radiation of appliances when operated as in normal use taking into account the manufacturer's instructions. It also covers abnormal situations that  can  be expected  in practice  and takes  into account  the way in which electromagnetic phenomena can affect the safe operation of appliances.This standard takes into account the requirements of IEC 60364 as far as possible so that there is compatibility with the wiring rules when the appliance is connected to the supply mains. However, national wiring rules may differ.If the functions of an appliance are covered by different parts 2 of IEC 60335, the relevant part 2 is applied to each function separately, as far as is reasonable. If applicable, the influence of one function on the other is taken into account.NOTE 1 Throughout this publication, when \u201cPart 2\u201d is mentioned, it refers to the relevant part of IEC 60335.When a part 2 standard does not include additional requirements to cover hazards dealt with in Part 1, Part 1 applies.NOTE 2 This means that the technical committees responsible for the part 2 standards have determined that it is not necessary to specify particular requirements for the appliance in question over and above the general requirements.This standard is a product family standard dealing with the safety of appliances and takes precedence over horizontal and generic standards covering the same subject.NOTE 3 Horizontal and generic standards covering a hazard are not applicable since they have been taken into consideration when developing the general and particular requirements for the IEC 60335 series of standards. For example, in the case of temperature requirements for surfaces on many appliances, generic standards, such as ISO 13732-1 for hot surfaces, are not applicable in addition to Part 1 or part 2 standards.Individual countries may wish to consider the application of the standard, as far as is reasonable, to appliances not mentioned in a part 2, and to appliances designed on new principles.An appliance that complies with the text of this standard will not necessarily be considered to comply with the safety principles of the standard if, when examined and tested, it is found to have other features which impair the level of safety covered by these requirements.An appliance employing materials or having forms of construction differing from those detailed in the requirements of this standard may be examined and tested according to the intent of the requirements and, if found to be substantially equivalent, may be considered to comply with the standard.NOTE 4 Standards dealing with non-safety aspects of household appliances areIEC standards published by TC 59 concerning methods of measuring performance;CISPR 11, CISPR 14-1, IEC 61000-3-2 and IEC 61000-3-3 concerning electromagnetic emissions;CISPR 14-2 concerning electromagnetic immunity;IEC standards published by TC 111 concerning environmental matters.60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010 \u2013 9 \u2013HOUSEHOLD AND SIMILAR ELECTRICAL APPLIANCES \u2013 SAFETY  \u2013Part 1: General requirementsScopeThis International Standard deals with the safety of electrical appliances for household and similar purposes, their rated voltage being not more than 250 V for single-phase appliances and 480 V for other appliances.NOTE 1 Battery-operated appliances and other d.c. supplied appliances are within the scope of this standard.Appliances not intended for normal household use but which nevertheless may be a source of danger to the public, such as appliances intended to be used by laymen in shops, in light industry and on farms, are within the scope of this standard.NOTE 2 Examples of such appliances are catering equipment, cleaning appliances for commercial use, and appliances for hairdressers.As far as is practicable, this standard  deals  with the  common hazards  presented by appliances that are encountered by all persons in and around the home. However, in general, it does not take into accountpersons (including children) whosephysical, sensory or mental capabilities; orlack of experience and knowledgeprevents them from using the appliance safely without supervision or instruction;children playing with the appliance.NOTE 3 Attention is drawn to the fact thatfor appliances intended to be used in vehicles or on board ships or aircraft, additional requirements may be necessary;in many countries, additional requirements are specified by the national health authorities, the national authorities responsible for the protection of labour, the national water supply authorities and similar authorities.NOTE 4 This standard does not apply toappliances intended exclusively for industrial purposes;appliances intended to be used in locations where special conditions prevail, such as the presence of a corrosive or explosive atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas);audio, video and similar electronic apparatus (IEC 60065);appliances for medical purposes (IEC 60601);hand-held motor-operated electric tools (IEC 60745);personal computers and similar equipment (IEC 60950-1);transportable motor-operated electric tools (IEC 61029).Normative referencesThe following referenced documents are indispensable for the application of this document.

However, the tests of Clauses 20, 22 (except 22.10, 22.11 and 22.18) to 26, 28, 30 and 31 may be carried out on separate appliances. The test of 22.3 is carried out on a new appliance.NOTE 1 Additional samples may be required if the appliance has to be tested under different conditions, for example if it can be supplied with different voltages.If an intentionally weak part becomes open circuit during the tests of Clause 19, an additional appliance may be needed.The testing of components may require the submission of additional samples of these components. If the test of Annex C has to be carried out, six samples of the motor are needed.If the test of Annex D has to be carried out, an additional appliance may be used. If the tests of Annex G are carried out, four additional transformers are needed.If the tests of Annex H are carried out, three switches or three additional appliances are needed.NOTE 2 The cumulative stress resulting from successive tests on electronic circuits is to be avoided. It may be necessary to replace components or to use additional samples. The number of additional samples should be kept to a minimum by an evaluation of the relevant electronic circuits.NOTE 3 If an appliance has to be dismantled in order to carry out a test, care is to be taken to ensure that it is reassembled as originally supplied. In case of doubt, subsequent tests may be carried out on a separate sample.The tests are carried out in the order of the clauses. However, the test of 22.11 on the appliance at room temperature is carried out before the tests of Clause 8. The tests of Clause 14 and 21.2 and 22.24 are carried out after the tests of Clause 29. The test of 19.14 is carried out before the tests of 19.11.If it is evident from the construction of the appliance that a particular test is not applicable, the test is not carried out.When testing appliances that are also supplied by other energies such as gas, the influence of their consumption has to be taken into account.The tests are carried out with the appliance or any movable part of it placed in the most unfavourable position that may occur in normal use.Appliances provided with controls or switching devices are tested with these controls or devices adjusted to their most unfavourable setting, if the setting can be altered by the user.NOTE 1 If the adjusting means of the control is accessible without the aid of a tool, this subclause applies whether the setting can be altered by hand or with the aid of a tool. If the adjusting means is not accessible without the aid of a tool and if the setting is not intended to be altered by the user, this subclause does not apply.NOTE 2 Adequate sealing is regarded as preventing alteration of the setting by the user.\u2013 22 \u2013 60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010For appliances fitted with a voltage selector switch, unless otherwise specified, the tests are carried out with the switch in the position corresponding to the rated voltage value used for the tests.The tests are carried out in a draught-free location at an ambient temperature of 20 \u00b0C \u00b1 5 \u00b0C.If the temperature attained by any part is limited by a temperature sensitive device or is influenced by the temperature at which a change of state occurs, for example when water boils, the ambient temperature is maintained at 23 \u00b0C \u00b1 2 \u00b0C in case of doubt.Test conditions relating to frequency and voltageAppliances for a.c. only are tested with a.c. at rated frequency, and those for a.c. andd.c. are tested at the more unfavourable supply.Appliances for a.c. that are not marked with rated frequency or are marked with a rated frequency range of 50 Hz to 60 Hz are tested with either 50 Hz or 60 Hz, whichever is the more unfavourable.Appliances having more than one rated voltage are tested on the basis of the most unfavourable voltage.For motor-operated appliances, and combined appliances, marked with a rated voltage range, when it is specified that the supply voltage is equal to the rated voltage multiplied by a factor, the appliance is supplied atthe upper limit of the rated voltage range multiplied by this factor, if greater than 1;the lower limit of the rated voltage range multiplied by this factor, if smaller than 1.When a factor is not specified, the supply voltage is the most unfavourable within the rated voltage range.NOTE 1 If a heating appliance has a rated voltage range, the upper limit of the voltage range will usually be the most unfavourable voltage within the range.NOTE 2 For motor-operated appliances, combined appliances and appliances having more than one rated voltage or rated voltage range, it may be necessary to make some of the tests at the minimum, the mean and the maximum values of the rated voltage or the rated voltage range in order to establish the most unfavourable voltage.For heating appliances, and combined appliances, marked with a rated power input range, when it is specified that the power input is equal to the rated power input multiplied by a factor, the appliance is operated atthe upper limit of the rated power input range multiplied by this factor, if greater than 1;the lower limit of the rated power input range multiplied by this factor, if smaller than 1.When a factor is not specified, the power input is the most unfavourable within the rated power input range.For appliances  marked with  a rated voltage  range  and rated  power input corresponding to the mean of the rated voltage range, when it is specified that the power input is equal to rated power input multiplied by a factor, the appliance is operated atthe calculated power input corresponding to the upper limit of the rated voltage rangemultiplied by this factor, if greater than 1;60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010 \u2013 23 \u2013the calculated power input corresponding to the lower limit of the rated voltage rangemultiplied by this factor, if smaller than 1.When a factor is not specified, the power input corresponds to the power input at the most unfavourable voltage within the rated voltage range.When alternative heating elements or accessories are made available by the appliance manufacturer, the appliance is tested with those elements or accessories which give the most unfavourable results.The tests are carried out on the  appliance as supplied. However,  an appliance constructed as a single appliance but supplied in a number of units is tested after assembly in accordance with the instructions provided with the appliance.Built-in appliances and fixed appliances are installed in accordance with the instructions provided with the appliance before testing.Appliances intended to be connected to fixed wiring by means of a flexible cord are tested with the appropriate flexible cord connected to the appliance.For heating appliances and combined appliances, when it is specified that the appliance has to operate at a power input multiplied by a factor, this applies only to heating elements without appreciable positive temperature coefficient of resistance.For heating elements with appreciable positive temperature coefficient of resistance, other than PTC heating elements, the supply voltage is determined by supplying the appliance at rated voltage until the heating element reaches its operating temperature. The supply voltage is then rapidly increased to the value necessary to give the power input required for the relevant test, this value of the supply voltage being maintained throughout the test.NOTE In general, the temperature coefficient is considered to be appreciable if, at rated voltage, the power input of the appliance in cold condition differs by more than 25 % from the power input at operating temperature.The tests for appliances with PTC heating elements and for heating appliances and combined appliances where the heating elements are supplied via a switch mode power supply are carried out at a voltage corresponding to the specified power input.When a power input greater than the rated power input is specified, the factor for multiplying the voltage is equal to the square root of the factor for multiplying the power input.If class 0I appliances or class I appliances have accessible metal parts that are not earthed and are not separated from live parts by an intermediate metal part that is earthed, such parts are checked for compliance with the appropriate requirements specified for class II construction.If class 0I appliances or class I appliances have accessible non-metallic parts, such parts are checked for compliance with the appropriate requirements specified for class II construction unless these parts are separated from live parts by an intermediate metal part that is earthed.NOTE Guidance is given in Annex P for enhanced requirements that may be used to ensure an acceptable level of protection against electrical and thermal hazards for particular types of appliances used in an installation without a protective earthing conductor in countries that have warm damp equable climates.If appliances have parts operating at safety extra-low voltage, such parts are checked for compliance with the appropriate requirements specified for class III construction.\u2013 24 \u2013 60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010When testing electronic circuits, the supply is to be free from perturbations from external sources that can influence the results of the tests.Appliances powered by rechargeable batteries are tested in accordance with Annex B.If linear and angular dimensions are specified without a tolerance, ISO 2768-1 is applicable.If a component or part of the appliance has both a self resetting feature and a non- self-resetting feature and if the non-self-resetting feature is not required in order to comply with the standard, then appliances incorporating such a component or part shall be tested with the non-self-resetting feature rendered inoperative.", "Appliances shall be of one of the following classes with respect to protection against electric shock:class 0, class 0I, class I, class II, class III.Compliance is checked by inspection and by the relevant tests.Appliances shall have the appropriate degree of protection against harmful ingress of water.Compliance is checked by inspection and by the relevant tests.NOTE The degrees of protection against harmful ingress of water are given in IEC 60529.", "Appliances shall be marked with therated voltage or rated voltage range in volts;symbol for nature of supply, unless the rated frequency is marked;rated power input in watts or rated current in amperes;name, trade mark or identification mark of the manufacturer or responsible vendor;model or type reference;symbol IEC 60417-5172 (2003-02) for class II appliances only;IP number according to degree of protection against ingress of water, other than IPX0;symbol IEC 60417-5180 (2003-02), for class  III appliances. This marking  is not necessary for appliances that are operated only by batteries  (primary batteries  or secondary batteries that are recharged outside of the appliance).NOTE 1 The first numeral of the IP number need not be marked on the appliance.NOTE 2 Additional markings are allowed provided they do not give rise to misunderstanding.NOTE 3 If components are marked separately, the marking of the appliance and that of the components is to be such that there can be no doubt with regard to the marking of the appliance itself.NOTE 4 If the appliance is marked with rated pressure, the units used may be bars but only together with pascals and placed in brackets.60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010 \u2013 25 \u2013The enclosure of electrically-operated water valves incorporated in external hose-sets for connection of an appliance to the water mains shall be marked with symbol IEC 60417-5036 (2002-10) if their working voltage exceeds extra-low voltage.Compliance is checked by inspection.Stationary appliances for multiple supply shall be marked with the substance of the following:Warning: Before obtaining access to terminals, all supply circuits must be disconnected.This warning shall be placed in the vicinity of the terminal cover.Compliance is checked by inspection.Appliances having  a range  of rated  values  and which can be operated without adjustment throughout the range shall be marked with the lower and upper limits of the range separated by a hyphen.NOTE 1 Example: 115-230 V: The appliance is suitable for any value within the marked range (a curling iron with a PTC heating element or an appliance incorporating an input switch mode power supply).Appliances having different rated values and which have to be adjusted for use at a particular value by the user or installer shall be marked with the different values separated by an oblique stroke.NOTE 2 Example: 115/230 V: The appliance is only suitable for the marked values (a shaver with a selector switch).NOTE 3 This requirement is also applicable to appliances with provision for connection to both single-phase and multi-phase supplies.Example: 230 V/400 V: The appliance is only suitable for the voltage values indicated, 230 V being for single- phase operation and 400 V for three-phase operation (a dishwasher with terminals for both supplies).Compliance is checked by inspection.If the appliance can be adjusted for different rated voltages, the voltage to which the appliance is adjusted shall be clearly discernible. If frequent changes in voltage setting are not required, this requirement is considered to  be met if the rated voltage to which the appliance is to be adjusted can be determined from a wiring diagram fixed to the appliance.NOTE The wiring diagram may be on the inside of a cover that has to be removed to connect the supply conductors. It is not to be on a label loosely attached to the appliance.Compliance is checked by inspection.For appliances marked with more than one rated voltage or with one or more rated voltage ranges, the rated power input or rated current for each of these voltages or ranges shall be marked. However, if the difference between the limits of a rated voltage range does not exceed 10 % of the arithmetic mean value of the range, the marking for rated power input or rated current may be related to the arithmetic mean value of the range.The upper and lower limits of the rated power input or rated current shall be marked on the appliance so that the relation between input and voltage is clear.Compliance is checked by inspection.When symbols are used, they shall be as follows\u2013 26 \u2013 60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010[symbol IEC 60417- 5031(2002-10)]direct current[symbol IEC 60417- 5032(2002-10)]alternating current3                [symbol IEC 60417- 5032-1(2002-10)]three-phase alternating current3N            [symbol IEC 60417- 5032-2(2002-10)]three-phase alternating current with neutral[symbol IEC 60417- 5016(2002-10)]fuse-linkNOTE 1 The rated current of the fuse link may be indicated in association with this symbol.time-lag miniature fuse-link  where X is the symbol  for the time/current characteristic as given in IEC 60127[symbol IEC 60417- 5019(2006-08)][symbol IEC 60417- 5018(2006-10)][symbol IEC 60417- 5172(2003-02)][symbol IEC 60417- 5012(2002-10)]protective earthfunctional earthingclass II equipmentlampNOTE 2 The rated wattage of the lamp may be indicated in association with this symbol.[symbol ISO 7000-0434(2004-01)]caution[symbol ISO 7000-0790(2004-01)]read operator's manual[symbol IEC 60417- 5021(2002-10)]equipotentiality[symbol IEC 60417-5036(2002-10)]dangerous voltage[symbol IEC 60417-5180(2003-02)]Class III applianceThe symbol for nature of supply shall be placed next to the marking for rated voltage.60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010 \u2013 27 \u2013The symbol for class II appliances shall be placed so that it will be obvious that it is a part of the technical information and is unlikely to be confused with any other marking.Units of physical quantities and their symbols shall be those of the international standardized system.NOTE 3 Additional symbols are allowed provided that they do not give rise to misunderstanding.

The temperature rise of the cord sheath is determined as near as possible to the hub of the reel and also between the two outermost layers of the cord on the reel.For cord  storage devices, other  than  automatic cord  reels,  which  are intended to accommodate the supply cord partially while the appliance is in operation, 50 cm of the cord is unwound. The temperature rise of the stored part of the cord is determined at the most unfavourable place.Temperature rises, other than those of windings, are determined by means of fine-wire thermocouples positioned so that they have minimum effect on the temperature of the part under test.NOTE 1 Thermocouples having wires with a diameter not exceeding 0,3 mm are considered to be fine-wire thermocouples.Thermocouples used for determining the temperature rise of the surface of walls, ceiling and floor of the test corner are attached to the back of small blackened disks of copper or brass, 15 mm in diameter and 1 mm thick. The front of the disk is flush with the surface of the board.As far as is possible, the appliance is positioned so that the thermocouples detect the highest temperatures.The temperature rise of electrical insulation, other than that of windings, is determined on the surface of the insulation at places where failure could causea short circuit;contact between live parts and accessible metal parts;bridging of insulation;a reduction of clearances  or creepage distances below the values  specified in Clause 29.NOTE 2 If it is necessary to dismantle the appliance to position thermocouples, care has to be taken to ensure that the appliance has been correctly reassembled. In case of doubt, the power input is remeasured.NOTE 3 The point of separation of the cores of a multicore cord and the point where insulated wires enter lampholders are examples of places where thermocouples are positioned.Temperature rises of windings are determined by the resistance method unless the windings are  non-uniform or if it is difficult to make the necessary connections, in which case the temperature rise is determined by means of thermocouples. At the beginning of the test, the windings are to be at room temperature.\u2013 36 \u2013 60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010The temperature rise of a winding is calculated from the formula:\u0394t =R2 \u2212 R1 R1(k + t1) \u2013 (t2 \u2013 t1)where\u0394t is the temperature rise of the winding;R1 is the resistance at the beginning of the test; R2 is the resistance at the end of the test;k is equal to225 for aluminium windings and copper/aluminium windings with an aluminium content\u2265 85 %,229,75 for copper/aluminium windings with an copper content > 15 % to < 85 %,234,5 for copper windings and copper/aluminium windings with an copper content\u2265 85 %;t1 is the room temperature at the beginning of the test; t2 is the room temperature at the end of the test.NOTE 4 It is recommended that the resistance of windings at the end of the test be determined by taking resistance measurements as soon as possible after switching off and then at short intervals so that a curve of resistance against time can be plotted for ascertaining the resistance at the instant of switching off.Heating appliances are operated under normal operation and at 1,15 times rated power input.Motor-operated appliances are operated under normal operation and supplied with the most unfavourable voltage between 0,94 times and 1,06 times the rated voltage.Combined appliances are operated under normal operation and supplied with the most unfavourable voltage between 0,94 times and 1,06 times the rated voltage.The appliance is operated for a duration corresponding to the most unfavourable conditions of normal use.NOTE The duration of the test may consist of more than one cycle of operation.During the test, the temperature rises are monitored continuously and shall not exceed the values shown in Table 3. The temperature rise limit for metal applies to parts having a metal coating at least 0,1 mm thick and to metal parts having a plastic coating less than 0,3 mm thick.If the temperature rise of the motor winding exceeds the value specified in Table 3 or if there is doubt with regard to the temperature classification of the insulation of the motor, the tests of Annex C are carried out.Protective devices shall not operate and sealing compound shall not flow out.

However, the temperature rise values specified are based on 25 \u00b0C.NOTE 3 The temperature of the terminals of switches is measured if the switch is tested in accordance with Annex H.a To allow for the fact that the average temperature of windings of universal motors, relays, solenoids and similar components is usually above the temperature at the points on the windings where thermocouples are placed, the figures without parentheses apply when the resistance method is used and those within parentheses apply when thermocouples are used. For windings of vibrator coils and a.c. motors, the figures without parentheses apply in both cases.The temperature rise limit of windings in transformers and inductors mounted on printed circuit boards is equal to the thermal class of the winding insulation reduced by 25 K provided the largest dimension of the winding does not exceed 5 mm in cross section or length.For motors constructed so that the circulation of air between the inside and the outside of the case is prevented but which are not necessarily sufficiently enclosed to be considered airtight, the temperature rise limits may be increased by 5 K.b T means the maximum ambient temperature in which the component or its switch head can operate.The ambient is the temperature of the air at the hottest point at a distance of 5 mm from the surface of the component concerned. However, if a thermostat or a temperature limiter is mounted on a heat-conducting part, the declared temperature limit of the mounting surface (Ts) is also applicable. Therefore, the temperature rise of the mounting surface has to be measured.The temperature rise limit does not apply to switches or controls tested in accordance with the conditions occurring in the appliance.c This limit may be exceeded if the instruction specified in 7.12.3 is supplied.d Locations for measuring the temperature rises are specified in Table 12.1 of IEC 60598-1.e The values in parentheses apply to locations where the part is fixed to a hot surface.f There is no specific limit for thermoplastic material. However, the temperature rise has to be determined in order that the tests of 30.1 can be carried out.g The limit specified concerns the deterioration of wood and it does not take into account deterioration of surface finishes.h There is no limit for the temperature rise of capacitors that are short-circuited in 19.11.i Temperature marking for capacitors mounted on printed circuit boards may be given in the technical sheet.j IEC 60245 Types 53 and 57 supply cords have a T rating of 60 \u00b0C; IEC 60245 Type 88 supply cords have a T rating of 70 \u00b0C;IEC 60227 Types 52 and 53 supply cords have a T rating of 70 \u00b0C; IEC 60227 Types 56 and 57 supply cords have a T rating of 90 \u00b0C.", "At operating temperature, the leakage current of the appliance shall not be excessive and its electric strength shall be adequate.Compliance is checked by the tests of 13.2 and 13.3.The appliance is operated under normal operation for the duration specified in 11.7.Heating appliances are operated at 1,15 times the rated power input.\u2013 40 \u2013 60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010Motor-operated appliances and combined appliances are supplied at 1,06 times rated voltage.Three-phase appliances, which according to the instructions for installation are also suitable for single-phase supply, are tested as single-phase appliances with the three circuits connected in parallel.Protective impedance and radio interference filters are disconnected before carrying out the tests.For class 0 appliances, class II appliances and class III appliances, the leakage current is measured by means of the circuit described in Figure 4 of IEC 60990. For other appliances, a low impedance ammeter capable of measuring the true r.m.s. value of  the leakage current may be used.The leakage current is measured between any pole of the supply and accessible metal parts connected to metal foil having an area not exceeding 20 cm \u00d7 10 cm which is in contact with accessible surfaces of insulating materials.The metal foil has the largest area possible on the surface under test without exceeding the dimensions specified. If its area is smaller than the surface under test, it is moved to test all parts of the surface. The heat dissipation of the appliance is not to be affected by the metal foil.For single-phase appliances, the measuring circuit is shown in the following figures:if of class II, Figure 1;if other than class II, Figure 2.The leakage current is measured with the selector switch in each of the positions a and b.For three-phase appliances, the measuring circuit is shown in the following figures:if of class II, Figure 3;if other than class II, Figure 4.For three-phase appliances, the leakage current is measured with the switches a, b and c in the closed position. The measurements are then repeated with each of the switches a, b and c open in turn, the other two switches remaining closed. For appliances intended to be connected in star connection only, the neutral is not connected.After the appliance has been operated for a duration as specified in 11.7, the leakage current shall not exceed the following values:for class II appliances 0,35 mA peakfor class 0 and class III appliances 0,7 mA peakfor class 0I appliances 0,5 mAfor portable class I appliances 0,75 mAfor stationary class I motor-operated appliances 3,5 mAfor stationary class I heating appliances 0,75 mA or 0,75 mA per kW ratedpower input of the appliance with a maximum of 5 mA, whichever  is higher60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010 \u2013 41 \u2013For combined appliances, the total leakage current may be within the limits specified for heating appliances or motor-operated appliances, whichever is the greater, but the two limits are not added.If the appliance incorporates capacitors and is provided with a single-pole switch, the measurements are repeated with the switch in the off position.If the appliance incorporates a thermal control which operates during the test of Clause 11, the leakage current is measured immediately before the control opens the circuit.NOTE 1 The test with the switch in the off position is carried out to verify that capacitors connected behind a single-pole switch do not cause an excessive leakage current.NOTE 2 It is recommended that the appliance is supplied through an isolating transformer; otherwise it is to be insulated from earth.The appliance is disconnected from the supply and the insulation is immediately subjected to a voltage having a frequency of 50 Hz or 60 Hz for 1 min, in accordance with IEC 61180-1.The high-voltage source used for the test is to be capable of supplying a short circuit current Is between the output terminals after the output voltage has been adjusted to the appropriate test voltage.

However, controls are not short-circuited but one end of the element is connected to the sheath of the heating element.This test is repeated with the polarity of the supply to the appliance reversed and with the other end of the element connected to the sheath.The test is not carried out on appliances intended to be permanently connected to fixed wiring and on appliances where an all-pole disconnection occurs during the test of 19.4.Appliances with a neutral are tested with the neutral connected to the sheath.NOTE For embedded heating elements, the metal enclosure is considered to be the sheath.Appliances with PTC heating elements are supplied at rated voltage until steady conditions with regard to power input and temperature are established.The working voltage of the PTC heating element is increased by 5 % and the appliance is operated until steady conditions are re-established. The voltage is then increased in similar steps until 1,5 times working voltage is reached, or until the PTC heating element ruptures, whichever occurs first.60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010 \u2013 49 \u2013The appliance is operated under stalled conditions bylocking the rotor of appliances for which the locked rotor torque is smaller than the full load torque;locking moving parts of other appliances.If an appliance has more than one motor, the test is carried out for each motor separately.Appliances incorporating motors and having capacitors in the circuit of an auxiliary winding, are operated with the rotor locked, the capacitors being open-circuited one at a time. The test is repeated with the capacitors short-circuited one at a time, unless they are of class P2 of IEC 60252-1.NOTE 1 This test is carried out with the rotor locked since some motors may start thus giving rise to inconsistent results.For each of the tests, appliances provided with a timer or programmer are supplied at rated voltage for a period equal to the maximum period allowed by the timer or programmer.Other appliances are supplied at rated voltage for a periodof 30 s forhand-held appliances,appliances that have to be kept switched on by hand or foot, andappliances that are continuously loaded by hand;of 5 min for other appliances that are operated while attended;until steady conditions are established, for other appliances.NOTE 2 Appliances that are tested for 5 min are indicated in the relevant part 2.During the test, the temperature of the windings shall not exceed the relevant value specified in Table 8.Table 8 \u2013 Maximum winding temperatureType of applianceTemperature\u00b0CClass 105 (A)Class 120 (E)Class 130 (B)Class 155 (F)Class 180 (H)Class 200 (N)Class 220 (R)Class 250Appliances other than those operated until steady conditions are established200215225240260280300330Appliances operated until steady conditions are established150165175190210230250280200215225240260280300330175190200215235255275305150165175190210230250280if impedance protectedif protected by a protective deviceduring the first hour, maximum valueafter the first hour, maximum valueafter the first hour, arithmetic averageOne phase of appliances incorporating multi-phase motors is disconnected. The appliance is then operated under normal operation and supplied at rated voltage for the period specified in 19.7.\u2013 50 \u2013 60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010A running overload test is carried out on appliances incorporating motors that are intended to be remotely or automatically controlled or liable to be operated continuously.Motor-operated appliances  and combined appliances for which  Subclause  30.2.3  is applicable and that use overload protective devices relying on electronic circuits to protect the motor windings, other than those that sense winding temperatures directly, are also subjected to the running overload test.The appliance is operated under normal operation and supplied at rated voltage until steady conditions are established. The load is then increased so that the current through the motor windings is raised by 10 % and the appliance is operated again until steady conditions are established, the supply voltage being maintained at its original value. The load is again increased and the test is repeated until the protective device operates or the motor stalls.During the test, the winding temperature shall not exceed140 \u00b0C, for class 105 (A) winding insulation;155 \u00b0C, for class 120 (E) winding insulation;165 \u00b0C, for class 130 (B) winding insulation;180 \u00b0C, for class 155 (F) winding insulation;200 \u00b0C, for class 180 (H) winding insulation;220 \u00b0C, for class 200 (N) winding insulation;240 \u00b0C, for class 220 (R) winding insulation;270 \u00b0C, for class 250 winding insulation.NOTE If the load cannot be increased in appropriate steps, the motor may be removed from the appliance and tested separately.Appliances incorporating series motors are operated with the lowest possible load and supplied at 1,3 times rated voltage for 1 min.During the test, parts shall not be ejected from the appliance.Electronic circuits are checked by evaluation of the fault conditions specified in19.11.2 for all circuits or parts of circuits, unless they comply with the conditions specified in 19.11.1.NOTE 1 In general, examination of the appliance and its circuit diagram will reveal the fault conditions which have to be simulated, so that testing can be limited to those cases that may be expected to give the most unfavourable results.Appliances incorporating an electronic circuit that relies upon a programmable component to function correctly are subjected to the test of 19.11.4.8, unless restarting at any point in the operating cycle after interruption of operation due to a supply voltage dip will not result in a hazard. The test is carried out after removal of all batteries and other components intended to maintain the programmable component supply voltage during mains supply voltage dips, interruptions and variations.Appliances having a device with an off position obtained by electronic disconnection, or a device that can place the appliance in a stand-by mode, are subjected to the tests of 19.11.4.NOTE 2 For information on general guidance relating to the sequence of tests for the evaluation of electronic circuits, reference should be made to Annex Q. It should be realized that in the Parts 2 there may be additional or alternative abnormal operation tests specified; these are not shown in the flow chart. For correct application of the standard, the normative text takes precedence over the guidance given in Annex Q.If the safety of the appliance under any of the fault conditions depends on the operation of a miniature fuse-link complying with IEC 60127, the test of 19.12 is carried out.60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010 \u2013 51 \u2013During and after each test, the temperature of windings shall not exceed the values specified in Table 8. However, these limits do not apply to fail-safe transformers complying with Subclause 15.5 of IEC 61558-1. The appliance shall comply with the conditions specified in19.13. Any current  flowing through protective impedance shall not exceed the limits specified in 8.1.4.NOTE 3 Unless it is necessary to replace components after any of the tests, the electric strength test required by19.13 need only be carried out after the final test on the electronic circuit.If a conductor of a printed circuit board becomes open-circuited, the appliance is considered to have withstood the particular test, provided both of the following conditions are met:the base material of the printed circuit board withstands the test of Annex E;any loosened conductor does not reduce clearances or creepage distances between live parts and accessible metal parts below the values specified in Clause 29.Fault conditions a) to g) specified in 19.11.2 are not applied to circuits or parts of circuits when both of the following conditions are met:the electronic circuit is a low-power circuit as described below;protection against electric shock, fire hazard, mechanical hazard or dangerous malfunction of other parts of the appliance does not rely on the correct functioning of the electronic circuit.An example of a low-power circuit is shown in Figure 6 and is determined as follows.The appliance is supplied at rated voltage and a variable resistor, adjusted to its maximum resistance, is connected between the point to be investigated and the opposite pole of the supply source. The resistance is then decreased until the power consumed by the resistor reaches a maximum. Points closest to the supply source at which the maximum power delivered to this resistor does not exceed 15 W at the end of 5 s are called low-power points. The part of the circuit farther from the supply source than a low-power point is considered to be a low-power circuit.NOTE 1 The measurements should be made from only one pole of the supply source, preferably the one that gives the fewest low-power points.NOTE 2 When determining the low-power points, it is recommended to start with points close to the supply source.NOTE 3 The power consumed by the variable resistor should be measured by a wattmeter.The following fault conditions are considered and, if necessary, applied one at a time, consequential faults being taken into consideration:short circuit of functional insulation if clearances or creepage distances are less than the values specified in Clause 29;open circuit at the terminals of any component;short circuit of capacitors, unless they comply with IEC 60384-14;short circuit of any two terminals of an electronic component, other than an integrated circuit. This fault condition is not applied between the two circuits of an optocoupler;failure of triacs in the diode mode;failure of microprocessors and integrated circuits except components such as thyristors and triacs. All possible output signals are considered for faults occurring within the component. If it can be shown that a particular output signal is unlikely to occur, then the relevant fault is not considered.failure of an electronic power switching device in a partial turn-on mode with loss of gate (base) control.\u2013 52 \u2013 60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010NOTE 1 This mode may be simulated by disconnecting the electronic power switching device gate (base) terminal and connecting an external adjustable power supply between the gate (base) terminal and the source (emitter) terminal of the electronic power switching device. The power supply is then varied so as to achieve a current that will not damage the electronic power switching device but will give the most onerous conditions of test.NOTE 2 Examples of electronic power switching devices are field effect transistors (FET\u2019s and MOSFET\u2019s) and bipolar transistors (including IGBT\u2019s).Fault condition f) is applied to encapsulated and similar components if the circuit cannot be assessed by other methods.Positive temperature coefficient resistors are not short-circuited if they are used within the manufacturer's specification. However, PTC-S thermistors are short-circuited unless they comply with IEC 60738-1.In addition, each low-power circuit is short-circuited by connecting the low-power point to the pole of the supply source from which the measurements were made.For simulation of the fault conditions, the appliance is operated under the conditions specified in Clause 11 but supplied at rated voltage.When any of the fault conditions are simulated, the duration of the test isas specified in 11.7 but only for one operating cycle and only if the fault cannot be recognized by the user, for example, a change in temperature;as specified in 19.7, if the fault can be recognized by the user, for example, when the motor of a kitchen machine stops;until steady conditions are established, for circuits continuously connected to the supply mains, for example, stand-by circuits.In each case, the test is ended if a non-self-resetting interruption of the supply occurs within the appliance.If the appliance incorporates a protective electronic circuit which operates to ensure compliance with Clause 19, the relevant test is repeated with a single fault simulated, as indicated in a) to g) of 19.11.2.NOTE The compliance criteria applied for these tests are those detailed in 19.13.Appliances having a device with an off position obtained by electronic disconnection, or a device that can be placed in the stand-by mode, are subjected to the tests of 19.11.4.1 to 19.11.4.7. The tests are carried out with the appliance supplied at rated voltage, the device being set in the off position or in the stand-by mode.Appliances incorporating a protective electronic circuit are subjected to the tests ofto 19.11.4.7. The tests are carried out after the protective electronic circuit has operated during the relevant tests of Clause 19 except 19.2, 19.6 and 19.11.3. However, appliances that are operated for 30 s or 5 min during the test of 19.7 are not subjected to the tests for electromagnetic phenomena.The tests are carried  out with surge  protective devices disconnected,  unless they incorporate spark gaps.NOTE 1 If the appliance has several modes of operation, the tests are carried out with the appliance operating in each mode, if necessary.NOTE 2 Appliances incorporating electronic controls complying with the IEC 60730 series of standards are not exempt from the tests.60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010 \u2013 53 \u2013The appliance is subjected to electrostatic discharges in accordance with IEC 61000-4-2, test level 4 being applicable. Ten discharges having a positive polarity and ten discharges having a negative polarity are applied at each preselected point.The appliance is subjected to radiated fields in accordance with IEC 61000-4-3, test level 3 being applicable.The frequency ranges tested shall be 80 MHz to 1 000 MHz and 1,4 GHz to 2,0 GHz.NOTE The dwell time for each frequency is to be sufficient to observe a possible malfunction of the protectiveelectronic circuit.The appliance is subjected to fast transient bursts in accordance with IEC 61000-4-4. Test level 3 with a repetition rate of 5 kHz is applicable for signal and control lines. Test level 4 with a repetition rate of 5 kHz is applicable for the power supply lines. The bursts are applied for 2 min with a positive polarity and for 2 min with a negative polarity.The power supply terminals of the appliance are subjected to voltage surges in accordance with IEC 61000-4-5, five positive impulses and five negative impulses being applied at the selected points. Test level 3 is applicable for the line-to-line coupling mode, a generator having a source impedance of 2 \u03a9 being used. Test level 4 is applicable for the line-to-earth coupling mode, a generator having a source impedance of 12 \u03a9 being used.Earthed heating elements in class I appliances are disconnected during this test.NOTE If a feedback system depends on inputs related to a disconnected heating element, an artificial network may be needed.For appliances having surge arresters incorporating spark gaps, the test is repeated at a level that is 95 % of the flashover voltage.The appliance is subjected to injected currents in accordance with IEC 61000-4-6, test level 3 being applicable. During the test, all frequencies between 0,15 MHz to 80 MHz are covered.NOTE The dwell time for each frequency is to be sufficient to observe a possible malfunction of the protective electronic circuit.For appliances having a rated current not exceeding 16 A, the appliance is subjected to the class 3 voltage dips and interruptions in accordance with IEC 61000-4-11. The values specified in Table 1 and Table 2 of IEC 61000-4-11 are applied at zero crossing of the supply voltage.For appliances having a rated current exceeding 16 A, the appliance is subjected to the class 3 voltage dips and interruptions in accordance with IEC 61000-4-34. The values specified in Table 1 and Table 2 of IEC 61000-4-34 are applied at zero crossing of the supply voltage.The appliance is subjected to mains signals in accordance with IEC 61000-4-13, Table 11 with test level class 2 using the frequency steps according to Table 10.The appliance is supplied at rated voltage and operated under normal operation. After approximately 60 s, the power supply voltage is reduced to a level such that the appliance ceases to respond to user inputs or parts controlled by the programmable component cease to operate, whichever occurs first. This value of supply voltage is recorded. The appliance is supplied at rated voltage and operated under normal operation. The voltage is then reduced to a value of approximately 10 % less than the recorded voltage. It is held at this value for approximately 60 s and then increased to rated voltage. The rate of decrease and increase of the power supply voltage is to be approximately 10 V/s.\u2013 54 \u2013 60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010The appliance shall continue to either operate normally from the same point in its operating cycle at which the voltage decrease occurred or a manual operation shall be required to restart it.If safety of the appliance depends upon the operation of a miniature fuse-link complying with IEC 60127 during any of the fault conditions specified in 19.11.2, the test is repeated but with the miniature fuse-link replaced by an ammeter. If the current measureddoes not exceed 2,1 times the rated current of the fuse-link, the circuit is not considered to be adequately protected and the test is carried out with the fuse-link short-circuited;is at least 2,75 times the rated current of the fuse-link, the circuit is considered to be adequately protected;is between 2,1 times and 2,75 times the rated current of the fuse-link, the fuse link is short-circuited and the test is carried outfor the relevant period or for 30 min, whichever is the shorter, for quick acting fuse- links;for the relevant period or for 2 min, whichever is the shorter, for time lag fuse-links.NOTE 1 In case of doubt, the maximum resistance of the fuse-link has to be taken into account when determining the current.NOTE 2 The verification whether the fuse-link acts as a protective device is based on the fusing characteristics specified in IEC 60127, which also gives the information necessary to calculate the maximum resistance of the fuse-link.NOTE 3 Other fuses are considered to be intentionally weak parts in accordance with 19.1.During the tests, the appliance shall not emit flames, molten metal, or poisonous or ignitable gas in hazardous amounts and temperature rises shall not exceed the values shown in Table 9.After the tests, and when the appliance has cooled to approximately room temperature, compliance with Clause 8 shall not be impaired and the appliance shall comply with 20.2 if it can still be operated.Table 9 \u2013 Maximum abnormal temperature  risePartTemperature riseKWooden supports, walls, ceiling and floor of the test corner and wooden cabinets a150Insulation of the supply cord a without T marking, or with T marking up to 75 \u00b0C150Insulation of the supply cord a with T marking above 75 \u00b0CT+75Supplementary insulation and reinforced insulation other than thermoplastic materials b1,5 times the relevant value specified in Table 3a bFor motor-operated appliances, these temperature rises are not determined.There is no specific limit for supplementary insulation and reinforced insulation of thermoplastic material. However, the temperature rise has to be determined so that the test of 30.1 can be carried out.When the insulation, other than that of class III appliances or class III constructions that do not contain live parts, has cooled down to approximately room temperature, it shall withstand the electric strength test of 16.3, the test voltage, however, being as specified in Table 4.The humidity treatment of 15.3 is not applied before this electric strength test.60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010 \u2013 55 \u2013For appliances which are immersed in or filled with conducting liquid in normal use, the appliance is immersed in or filled with water for 24 h before the electric strength test is carried out.After the operation or interruption of a control, clearances and creepage distances across the functional insulation shall withstand the electric strength test of 16.3, the test voltage, however, being twice the working voltage.The appliance shall not undergo a dangerous malfunction, and there shall be no failure ofprotective electronic circuits if the appliance is still operable.Appliances tested with an electronic switch in the off position, or in the stand-by mode, shallnot become operational, orif they become operational, not result in a dangerous malfunction during or after the tests of 19.11.4.NOTE Unintended operation that may impair safety, can result from careless use of appliances, such as:storage of small appliances while connected to the supply;placing flammable material on working surfaces of heating appliances; orplacing objects in areas near motorized appliances that are not expected to start.In an appliance containing lids or doors that are controlled by one or more interlocks, one of the interlocks may be released provided that both of the following conditions are fulfilled:the lid or door does not move automatically to an open position when the interlock is released;the appliance will not restart after the cycle in which the interlock was released.Appliances are operated under the conditions of Clause 11. Any contactor or relay contact that operates under the conditions of Clause 11 is short-circuited.If a relay or contactor with more than one contact is used, all contacts are short-circuited at the same time.Any relay or contactor which operates only in order to ensure that the appliance is energized for normal use and that does not otherwise operate in normal use is not short-circuited.If more than one relay or contactor operates in Clause 11, each such relay or contactor is short-circuited in turn.NOTE If the appliance has several modes of operation, the tests are carried out with the appliance operating in each mode, if necessary.For appliances incorporating a mains voltage selector switch, this switch is set to the lowest rated voltage position and the highest value of rated voltage is applied.", "Appliances, other than fixed appliances and hand-held appliances, intended to be used on a surface such as the floor or a table, shall have adequate stability.Compliance is checked by the following test, appliances incorporating an appliance inlet being fitted with an appropriate connector and flexible cord.\u2013 56 \u2013 60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010The appliance, not connected to the supply mains, is placed in any normal position of use on a plane inclined at an angle of 10\u00b0 to the horizontal, the supply cord resting on the inclined plane in the most unfavourable position. However, if part of an appliance comes into contact with the horizontal supporting surface when the appliance is tilted through an angle of 10\u00b0, the appliance is placed on a horizontal support and tilted in the most unfavourable direction through an angle of 10\u00b0.NOTE The test on the horizontal support may be necessary for appliances provided with rollers, castors or feet. In this case, castors or wheels may be blocked to prevent the appliance from rolling.Appliances provided with doors are tested with the doors open or closed, whichever is the more unfavourable.Appliances intended to be filled with liquid by the user in normal use are tested empty or filled with the most unfavourable quantity of water up to the capacity indicated in the instructions.The appliance shall not overturn.The test is repeated on appliances with heating elements with the angle of inclination increased to 15\u00b0. If the appliance overturns in one or more positions, it is subjected to the tests of Clause 11 in each of these overturned positions.During this test, temperature rises shall not exceed the values shown in Table 9.Moving parts of appliances shall, as far as is compatible with the use and working of the appliance, be positioned or enclosed to provide adequate protection against personal injury in normal use. This requirement does not apply to parts of an appliance that necessarily have to be exposed to allow the appliance to perform its working function.NOTE 1 Examples of parts of appliances necessarily exposed to perform the working function include the needle of a sewing machine, rotating brushes of vacuum cleaner and the blade of an electrical knife.Protective enclosures, guards and similar parts shall be non-detachable parts and shall have adequate mechanical strength. However, enclosures that can be opened by overriding an interlock by applying the test probe are considered to be detachable parts.The unexpected closure of self-resetting thermal cut-outs and overcurrent protective devices shall not cause a hazard.NOTE 2 An example of an appliance in which self-resetting thermal cut-outs and overcurrent protective devices could cause a hazard is a food mixer.Compliance is checked by inspection, by the test of 21.1 and by applying a force not exceeding 5 N by means of a test probe that is similar to test probe B of IEC 61032 but having a circular stop face with a diameter of 50 mm, instead of the non-circular face.For appliances provided with movable devices such as those intended for varying the tension of belts, the test with the test probe is carried out with these devices adjusted to the most unfavourable position within their range of adjustment. If necessary, belts are removed.It shall not be possible to touch dangerous moving parts with this test probe.", "Appliances shall have adequate mechanical strength and be constructed to withstand such rough handling that may be expected in normal use.60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010 \u2013 57 \u2013Compliance is checked by applying blows to the appliance in accordance with test Ehb of IEC 60068-2-75, the spring hammer test.The appliance is rigidly supported and three blows, having an impact energy of 0,5 J, are applied to every point of the enclosure that is likely to be weak.If necessary, the blows are also applied to handles, levers, knobs and similar parts and to signal lamps and their covers but only if the lamps or covers protrude from the enclosure by more than 10 mm or if their surface area exceeds 4 cm2. Lamps within the appliance and their covers are only tested if they are likely to be damaged in normal use.NOTE When applying the release cone to the guard of a visibly glowing heating element, care is to be taken that the hammer head passing through the guard does not strike the heating element.After the test, the appliance shall show no damage that could impair compliance with this standard and compliance with 8.1, 15.1 and Clause 29 shall not be impaired. In case of doubt, supplementary insulation and reinforced insulation are subjected to the electric strength test of 16.3.Damage to the finish, small dents that do not reduce clearances or creepage distances below the values specified in Clause 29, and small chips that do not adversely affect protection against access to live parts or moisture, are ignored.If a decorative cover is protected by an inner cover, fracture of the decorative cover is ignored if the inner cover itself withstands the test.If there is doubt as to whether a defect has occurred by the application of the preceding blows or the previous tests, this defect is neglected and the group of three blows is applied to the same place on a new sample which shall then withstand the test.Cracks not visible to the naked eye and surface cracks in fibre-reinforced mouldings and similar materials are ignored.Accessible parts  of solid insulation shall  have sufficient strength to prevent penetration by sharp implements.Compliance is checked by subjecting the insulation to the following test, unless the thickness of supplementary insulation is at least 1 mm and that of reinforced insulation is at least 2 mm.The insulation is raised to the temperature measured during the test of Clause 11. The surface of the insulation is then scratched by means of a hardened steel pin, the end of which has the form of a cone with an angle of 40\u00b0. Its tip is rounded with a radius of 0,25 mm \u00b1 0,02 mm. The pin is held at any angle from 80\u00b0 to 85\u00b0 to the horizontal and loaded so that the force exerted along its axis is 10 N \u00b1 0,5 N. The scratches are made by drawing the pin along the surface of the insulation at a speed of approximately 20 mm/s. Two parallel scratches are made. They are spaced sufficiently apart so that they are not affected by each other, their length covering approximately 25 % of the length of the insulation. Two similar scratches are made at 90\u00b0 to the first pair without crossing them.The test fingernail of Figure 7 is then applied to the scratched surface with a force of approximately 10 N. No further damage, such as separation of the material, shall occur. The insulation shall then withstand the electric strength test of 16.3.The hardened steel pin is then applied perpendicularly with a force of 30 N \u00b1 0,5 N to an unscratched part of the surface. The insulation shall then withstand the electric strength test of 16.3 with the pin still applied and used as one of the electrodes.\u2013 58 \u2013 60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010", "s of cord anchorages 111Figure 10 \u2013 An example of parts of an earthing terminal 112Figure 11 \u2013 Examples of clearances 113Figure 12 \u2013 Example of the placement of the cylinder 114Figure I.1 \u2013 Simulation of faults 129Figure L.1 \u2013 Sequence for the determination of clearances 133Figure L.2 \u2013 Sequence for the determination of creepage distances 135Figure O.1 \u2013 Tests for resistance to heat 138Figure O.2 \u2013 Selection and sequence of tests for resistance to fire in hand-heldappliances 139Figure O.3 \u2013 Selection and sequence of tests for resistance to fire in attendedappliances 140Figure O.4 \u2013 Selection and sequence of tests for resistance to fire in unattendedappliances 141Figure O.5 \u2013 Some applications of the term \"within a distance of 3 mm\" 143\u2013 4 \u2013 60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010Table 1 \u2013 Power input deviation 33Table 2 \u2013 Current deviation 34Table 3 \u2013 Maximum normal temperature rises 37Table 4 \u2013 Voltage for electric strength test 41Table 5 \u2013 Characteristics of high-voltage sources 42Table 6 \u2013 Impulse test voltage 42Table 7 \u2013 Test voltages 46Table 8 \u2013 Maximum winding temperature 49Table 9 \u2013 Maximum abnormal temperature rise 54Table 10 \u2013 Dimensions of cables and conduits 75Table 11 \u2013 Minimum cross-sectional area of conductors 77Table 12 \u2013 Pull force and torque 79Table 13 \u2013 Nominal cross-sectional area of conductors 83Table 14 \u2013 Torque for testing screws and nuts 87Table 15 \u2013 Rated impulse voltage 89Table 16 \u2013 Minimum clearances 90Table 17 \u2013 Minimum creepage distances for basic insulation 94Table 18 \u2013 Minimum creepage distances for functional insulation 95Table 19 \u2013 Minimum thickness for accessible parts of reinforced insulation consistingof a single layer 96Table A.1 \u2013 Test voltages 116Table C.1 \u2013 Test conditions 120Table R.1 e \u2013 General fault/error conditions 150Table R.2 e \u2013 Specific fault/error conditions 153Table R.3 \u2013 Semi-formal methods 159Table R.4 \u2013 Software architecture specification 159Table R.5 \u2013 Module design specification 160Table R.6 \u2013 Design and coding standards 160Table R.7 \u2013 Software safety validation 16160335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010 \u2013 5 \u2013INTERNATIONAL ELECTROTECHNICAL COMMISSIONHOUSEHOLD AND SIMILAR ELECTRICAL APPLIANCES \u2013 SAFETY  \u2013Part 1: General requirementsFOREWORDThe International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) is a worldwide organization for standardization comprising all national electrotechnical committees (IEC National Committees). The object of IEC is to promote international co-operation on all questions concerning standardization in the electrical and electronic fields. To this end and in addition to other activities, IEC publishes International Standards, Technical Specifications, Technical Reports, Publicly Available Specifications (PAS) and Guides (hereafter referred to as \u201cIEC Publication(s)\u201d). Their preparation is entrusted to technical committees; any IEC National Committee interested in the subject dealt with may participate in this preparatory work. International, governmental and non- governmental organizations liaising with the IEC also participate in this preparation. IEC collaborates closely with the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in accordance with conditions determined by agreement between the two organizations.The formal decisions or agreements of IEC on technical matters express, as nearly as possible, an international consensus of opinion on the relevant subjects since each technical committee has representation from all interested IEC National Committees.IEC Publications have the form of recommendations for international use and are accepted by IEC National Committees in that sense. While all reasonable efforts are made to ensure that the technical content of IEC Publications is accurate, IEC cannot be held responsible for the way in which they are used or for any misinterpretation by any end user.In order to promote international uniformity, IEC National Committees undertake to apply IEC Publications transparently to the maximum extent possible in their national and regional publications.

At this date, the publication will bereconfirmed,withdrawn,replaced by a revised edition, oramended.NOTE 3 The attention of National Committees is drawn to the fact that equipment manufacturers and testing organizations may need a transitional period following publication of a new, amended or revised IEC publication in which to make products in accordance with the new requirements and to equip themselves for conducting new or revised tests.It is the recommendation of the committee that the content of this publication be adopted for implementation nationally not earlier than 12 months or later than 36 months from the date of publication.60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010 \u2013 7 \u2013The following differences exist in the countries indicated below.Introduction: The Part 1 standard (UL60335-1) is only used in combination with a part 2 (UL60335-2-x).National differences are specified in these standards (USA).5.7: The ambient temperature is 25 \u00b0C \u00b1 10 \u00b0C (Japan).5.7: The ambient temperature is 27 \u00b0C \u00b1 5 \u00b0C (India).6.1: Class 0 appliances and class 0I appliances are not allowed (Australia, Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, India, Israel, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Singapore, Slovakia, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom).7.12.2: The requirements for full disconnection do not apply (Japan).13.2: The test circuit and some leakage current limits are different (India).22.2: The second paragraph of this subclause dealing with single-phase class I appliances with heating elements cannot be complied with because of the supply system (France and Norway).22.2: Double-pole switches or protective devices are required (Norway).22.35 Accessible metal parts separated from live parts by earthed metal parts are not regarded as likely to become live in the event of an insulation fault (USA).24.1: IEC component standard requirements are replaced by the relevant requirements of component standards specified in UL60335-1 and parts 2 (UL60335-2-x) (USA).25.3: A set of supply leads is not permitted (Norway, Denmark, Finland, Netherlands).25.8: 0,5 mm2 supply cords are not allowed for class I appliances (Australia and New Zealand).26.6: Conductor cross-sectional areas are different (USA).29.1: Different rated impulse voltages are used between 50 V and 150 V (Japan).\u2013 8 \u2013 60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010INTRODUCTIONIt has been assumed in the drafting of this International Standard that the execution of its provisions is entrusted to appropriately qualified and experienced persons.This standard recognizes the internationally accepted level of protection against hazards such as electrical, mechanical, thermal, fire and radiation of appliances when operated as in normal use taking into account the manufacturer's instructions. It also covers abnormal situations that  can  be expected  in practice  and takes  into account  the way in which electromagnetic phenomena can affect the safe operation of appliances.This standard takes into account the requirements of IEC 60364 as far as possible so that there is compatibility with the wiring rules when the appliance is connected to the supply mains. However, national wiring rules may differ.If the functions of an appliance are covered by different parts 2 of IEC 60335, the relevant part 2 is applied to each function separately, as far as is reasonable. If applicable, the influence of one function on the other is taken into account.NOTE 1 Throughout this publication, when \u201cPart 2\u201d is mentioned, it refers to the relevant part of IEC 60335.When a part 2 standard does not include additional requirements to cover hazards dealt with in Part 1, Part 1 applies.NOTE 2 This means that the technical committees responsible for the part 2 standards have determined that it is not necessary to specify particular requirements for the appliance in question over and above the general requirements.This standard is a product family standard dealing with the safety of appliances and takes precedence over horizontal and generic standards covering the same subject.NOTE 3 Horizontal and generic standards covering a hazard are not applicable since they have been taken into consideration when developing the general and particular requirements for the IEC 60335 series of standards. For example, in the case of temperature requirements for surfaces on many appliances, generic standards, such as ISO 13732-1 for hot surfaces, are not applicable in addition to Part 1 or part 2 standards.Individual countries may wish to consider the application of the standard, as far as is reasonable, to appliances not mentioned in a part 2, and to appliances designed on new principles.An appliance that complies with the text of this standard will not necessarily be considered to comply with the safety principles of the standard if, when examined and tested, it is found to have other features which impair the level of safety covered by these requirements.An appliance employing materials or having forms of construction differing from those detailed in the requirements of this standard may be examined and tested according to the intent of the requirements and, if found to be substantially equivalent, may be considered to comply with the standard.NOTE 4 Standards dealing with non-safety aspects of household appliances areIEC standards published by TC 59 concerning methods of measuring performance;CISPR 11, CISPR 14-1, IEC 61000-3-2 and IEC 61000-3-3 concerning electromagnetic emissions;CISPR 14-2 concerning electromagnetic immunity;IEC standards published by TC 111 concerning environmental matters.60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010 \u2013 9 \u2013HOUSEHOLD AND SIMILAR ELECTRICAL APPLIANCES \u2013 SAFETY  \u2013Part 1: General requirementsScopeThis International Standard deals with the safety of electrical appliances for household and similar purposes, their rated voltage being not more than 250 V for single-phase appliances and 480 V for other appliances.NOTE 1 Battery-operated appliances and other d.c. supplied appliances are within the scope of this standard.Appliances not intended for normal household use but which nevertheless may be a source of danger to the public, such as appliances intended to be used by laymen in shops, in light industry and on farms, are within the scope of this standard.NOTE 2 Examples of such appliances are catering equipment, cleaning appliances for commercial use, and appliances for hairdressers.As far as is practicable, this standard  deals  with the  common hazards  presented by appliances that are encountered by all persons in and around the home. However, in general, it does not take into accountpersons (including children) whosephysical, sensory or mental capabilities; orlack of experience and knowledgeprevents them from using the appliance safely without supervision or instruction;children playing with the appliance.NOTE 3 Attention is drawn to the fact thatfor appliances intended to be used in vehicles or on board ships or aircraft, additional requirements may be necessary;in many countries, additional requirements are specified by the national health authorities, the national authorities responsible for the protection of labour, the national water supply authorities and similar authorities.NOTE 4 This standard does not apply toappliances intended exclusively for industrial purposes;appliances intended to be used in locations where special conditions prevail, such as the presence of a corrosive or explosive atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas);audio, video and similar electronic apparatus (IEC 60065);appliances for medical purposes (IEC 60601);hand-held motor-operated electric tools (IEC 60745);personal computers and similar equipment (IEC 60950-1);transportable motor-operated electric tools (IEC 61029).Normative referencesThe following referenced documents are indispensable for the application of this document.

If an appliance with an enclosure of insulating material has provision for earthing internal parts, it is considered to be a class I appliance or class 0I appliance.3.3.8class 0I applianceappliance having at least basic insulation throughout and incorporating an earthing terminal but having a supply cord without earthing conductor and a plug without earthing contact3.3.9class I applianceappliance in which protection against electric shock does not rely on basic insulation only but which includes an additional safety precaution, in that conductive accessible parts are\u2013 16 \u2013 60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010connected to the protective earthing conductor in the fixed wiring of the installation in such a way that conductive accessible parts cannot become live in the event of a failure of the basic insulationNOTE This provision includes a protective earthing conductor in the supply cord.3.3.10class II applianceappliance in which protection against electric shock does not rely on basic insulation only but in which additional safety precautions are provided, such as double insulation or reinforced insulation, there being no provision for protective earthing or reliance upon installation conditionsNOTE 1 Such an appliance may be of one of the following types:an appliance having a durable and substantially continuous enclosure of insulating material which envelops all metal parts, with the exception of parts, such as nameplates, screws and rivets, which are isolated from live parts by insulation at least equivalent to reinforced insulation; such an appliance is called an insulation- encased class II appliance;an appliance having a substantially continuous metal enclosure, in which double insulation or reinforced insulation is used throughout; such an appliance is called a metal-encased class II appliance;an appliance which is a combination of an insulation-encased class II appliance and a metal-encased class II appliance.NOTE 2 The enclosure of an insulation-encased class II appliance may form a part or the whole of thesupplementary insulation or of the reinforced insulation.NOTE 3 If an appliance with double insulation or reinforced insulation throughout has provision for earthing, it is considered to be a class I appliance or a class 0I appliance.3.3.11class II constructionpart of an appliance for which protection against electric shock relies upon double insulationor reinforced insulation3.3.12class III applianceappliance in which protection against electric shock relies on supply at safety extra-low voltage and in which voltages higher than those of safety extra-low voltage are not generatedNOTE Basic insulation may be required in addition to supply at SELV. Refer to 8.1.4.3", "Wireways shall be smooth and free from sharp edges.Wires shall be protected so that they do not come into contact with burrs, cooling fins or similar edges which may cause damage to their insulation.Holes in metal through which insulated wires pass shall have smooth well-rounded surfaces or be provided with bushings.Wiring shall be effectively prevented from coming into contact with moving parts.Compliance is checked by inspection.Beads and similar ceramic insulators on live wires shall be fixed or located so that they cannot change their position or rest on sharp edges. If beads are inside flexible metal conduits, they shall be contained within an insulating sleeve, unless the conduit cannot move in normal use.Compliance is checked by inspection and by manual test.Different parts of an appliance that can move relative to each other in normal use or during user maintenance shall not cause undue stress to electrical connections and internal conductors, including those providing earthing continuity. Flexible metallic tubes shall not cause damage to the insulation of the conductors contained within them. Open-coil springs shall not be used to protect the wiring. If a coiled spring, the turns of which touch one another, is used for this purpose, there shall be an adequate insulating lining in addition to the insulation of the conductors.NOTE 1 The sheath of a flexible cord complying with IEC 60227 or IEC 60245 is regarded as an adequate insulating lining.60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010 \u2013 69 \u2013Compliance is checked by inspection and by the following test.If flexing occurs in normal use, the appliance is placed in the normal position of use and is supplied at rated voltage and operated under normal operation.The movable part is moved backwards and forwards, so that the conductor is flexed through the largest angle allowed by the construction, the rate of flexing being 30 per minute. The number of flexings is10 000, for conductors flexed during normal use;100, for conductors flexed during user maintenance.NOTE 2 A flexing is one movement, either backwards or forwards.The appliance shall not be damaged to the extent that compliance with this standard is impaired and it shall be fit for further use. In particular, the wiring and its connections shall withstand the electric strength test of 16.3, the test voltage being reduced to 1 000 V and applied between live parts and accessible metal parts only. In addition, not more than 10 % of the strands of any conductor of the internal wiring between the main part of the appliance and the movable part shall be broken. However, if the wiring supplies circuits that consume no more than 15 W, then no more than 30 % of the strands shall be broken.Bare internal wiring shall be rigid and fixed so that, in normal use, clearances orcreepage distances cannot be reduced below the values specified in Clause 29.Compliance is checked during the tests of 29.1 and 29.2.The insulation of internal wiring that is subjected to the supply mains voltage shall withstand the electrical stress likely to occur in normal use.Compliance is checked as follows.The basic insulation shall be electrically  equivalent to the basic insulation  of cords complying with IEC 60227 or IEC 60245 or comply with the following electric strength test.A voltage of 2 000 V is applied for 15 min between the conductor and metal foil wrapped around the insulation. There shall be no breakdown.NOTE 1 If the basic insulation of the conductor does not fulfil one of these conditions, the conductor is considered to be bare.NOTE 2 For class II construction, the requirements for supplementary insulation and reinforced insulation apply except that the sheath of a cord complying with IEC 60227 or IEC 60245 may provide supplementary insulation.When sleeving is used as supplementary insulation on internal wiring, the sleeving shall be retained in position by clamping at both ends or be such that it can only be removed by breaking or cutting.Compliance is checked by inspection and by manual test.Conductors identified by the colour combination green/yellow shall only be used for earthing conductors.Compliance is checked by inspection.Aluminium wires shall not be used for internal wiring.\u2013 70 \u2013 60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010NOTE Windings are not considered to be internal wiring.Compliance is checked by inspection.Stranded conductors shall not be consolidated by soldering where they are subjected to contact pressure, unless the contact pressure is provided by spring terminals.NOTE Soldering of the tip of a stranded conductor is allowed.Compliance is checked by inspection.The insulation and sheath of internal wiring, incorporated in external hoses for the connection of an appliance to the water mains, shall be at least equivalent to that of light polyvinyl chloride sheathed flexible cord (code designation 60227 IEC 52).Compliance is checked by inspection.NOTE The mechanical characteristics specified in IEC 60227 are not evaluated.", "that can be removed without the aid of a tool are considered to be detachable parts.3.6.3accessible partpart or surface that can be touched by means of test probe B of IEC 61032, and if the part or surface is metal, any conductive part connected to itNOTE Accessible non-metallic parts with conductive coatings are considered to be accessible metal parts.3.6.4live partconductor or conductive part intended to be energized in normal use, including a neutral conductor but, by convention, not a PEN conductorNOTE 1 Parts, accessible or not, complying with 8.1.4 are not considered to be live parts.NOTE 2 A PEN conductor is a protective earthed neutral conductor combining the functions of both a protective conductor and a neutral conductor.3.6.5toolscrewdriver, coin or any other object that may be used to operate a screw or similar fixing means60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010 \u2013 19 \u20133.6.6small partpart, where each surface lies completely within a circle of 15 mm diameter, or a part where some of the surface lies outside a 15 mm diameter circle but in such a way that it is not possible to fit a circle of 8 mm diameter on any of the surfacesNOTE A part that is too small to grip and at the same time to be able to apply the glow-wire tip is shown in example A in Figure 5.

However, the tests of Clauses 20, 22 (except 22.10, 22.11 and 22.18) to 26, 28, 30 and 31 may be carried out on separate appliances. The test of 22.3 is carried out on a new appliance.NOTE 1 Additional samples may be required if the appliance has to be tested under different conditions, for example if it can be supplied with different voltages.If an intentionally weak part becomes open circuit during the tests of Clause 19, an additional appliance may be needed.The testing of components may require the submission of additional samples of these components. If the test of Annex C has to be carried out, six samples of the motor are needed.If the test of Annex D has to be carried out, an additional appliance may be used. If the tests of Annex G are carried out, four additional transformers are needed.If the tests of Annex H are carried out, three switches or three additional appliances are needed.NOTE 2 The cumulative stress resulting from successive tests on electronic circuits is to be avoided. It may be necessary to replace components or to use additional samples. The number of additional samples should be kept to a minimum by an evaluation of the relevant electronic circuits.NOTE 3 If an appliance has to be dismantled in order to carry out a test, care is to be taken to ensure that it is reassembled as originally supplied. In case of doubt, subsequent tests may be carried out on a separate sample.The tests are carried out in the order of the clauses. However, the test of 22.11 on the appliance at room temperature is carried out before the tests of Clause 8. The tests of Clause 14 and 21.2 and 22.24 are carried out after the tests of Clause 29. The test of 19.14 is carried out before the tests of 19.11.If it is evident from the construction of the appliance that a particular test is not applicable, the test is not carried out.When testing appliances that are also supplied by other energies such as gas, the influence of their consumption has to be taken into account.The tests are carried out with the appliance or any movable part of it placed in the most unfavourable position that may occur in normal use.Appliances provided with controls or switching devices are tested with these controls or devices adjusted to their most unfavourable setting, if the setting can be altered by the user.NOTE 1 If the adjusting means of the control is accessible without the aid of a tool, this subclause applies whether the setting can be altered by hand or with the aid of a tool. If the adjusting means is not accessible without the aid of a tool and if the setting is not intended to be altered by the user, this subclause does not apply.NOTE 2 Adequate sealing is regarded as preventing alteration of the setting by the user.\u2013 22 \u2013 60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010For appliances fitted with a voltage selector switch, unless otherwise specified, the tests are carried out with the switch in the position corresponding to the rated voltage value used for the tests.The tests are carried out in a draught-free location at an ambient temperature of 20 \u00b0C \u00b1 5 \u00b0C.If the temperature attained by any part is limited by a temperature sensitive device or is influenced by the temperature at which a change of state occurs, for example when water boils, the ambient temperature is maintained at 23 \u00b0C \u00b1 2 \u00b0C in case of doubt.Test conditions relating to frequency and voltageAppliances for a.c. only are tested with a.c. at rated frequency, and those for a.c. andd.c. are tested at the more unfavourable supply.Appliances for a.c. that are not marked with rated frequency or are marked with a rated frequency range of 50 Hz to 60 Hz are tested with either 50 Hz or 60 Hz, whichever is the more unfavourable.Appliances having more than one rated voltage are tested on the basis of the most unfavourable voltage.For motor-operated appliances, and combined appliances, marked with a rated voltage range, when it is specified that the supply voltage is equal to the rated voltage multiplied by a factor, the appliance is supplied atthe upper limit of the rated voltage range multiplied by this factor, if greater than 1;the lower limit of the rated voltage range multiplied by this factor, if smaller than 1.When a factor is not specified, the supply voltage is the most unfavourable within the rated voltage range.NOTE 1 If a heating appliance has a rated voltage range, the upper limit of the voltage range will usually be the most unfavourable voltage within the range.NOTE 2 For motor-operated appliances, combined appliances and appliances having more than one rated voltage or rated voltage range, it may be necessary to make some of the tests at the minimum, the mean and the maximum values of the rated voltage or the rated voltage range in order to establish the most unfavourable voltage.For heating appliances, and combined appliances, marked with a rated power input range, when it is specified that the power input is equal to the rated power input multiplied by a factor, the appliance is operated atthe upper limit of the rated power input range multiplied by this factor, if greater than 1;the lower limit of the rated power input range multiplied by this factor, if smaller than 1.When a factor is not specified, the power input is the most unfavourable within the rated power input range.For appliances  marked with  a rated voltage  range  and rated  power input corresponding to the mean of the rated voltage range, when it is specified that the power input is equal to rated power input multiplied by a factor, the appliance is operated atthe calculated power input corresponding to the upper limit of the rated voltage rangemultiplied by this factor, if greater than 1;60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010 \u2013 23 \u2013the calculated power input corresponding to the lower limit of the rated voltage rangemultiplied by this factor, if smaller than 1.When a factor is not specified, the power input corresponds to the power input at the most unfavourable voltage within the rated voltage range.When alternative heating elements or accessories are made available by the appliance manufacturer, the appliance is tested with those elements or accessories which give the most unfavourable results.The tests are carried out on the  appliance as supplied. However,  an appliance constructed as a single appliance but supplied in a number of units is tested after assembly in accordance with the instructions provided with the appliance.Built-in appliances and fixed appliances are installed in accordance with the instructions provided with the appliance before testing.Appliances intended to be connected to fixed wiring by means of a flexible cord are tested with the appropriate flexible cord connected to the appliance.For heating appliances and combined appliances, when it is specified that the appliance has to operate at a power input multiplied by a factor, this applies only to heating elements without appreciable positive temperature coefficient of resistance.For heating elements with appreciable positive temperature coefficient of resistance, other than PTC heating elements, the supply voltage is determined by supplying the appliance at rated voltage until the heating element reaches its operating temperature. The supply voltage is then rapidly increased to the value necessary to give the power input required for the relevant test, this value of the supply voltage being maintained throughout the test.NOTE In general, the temperature coefficient is considered to be appreciable if, at rated voltage, the power input of the appliance in cold condition differs by more than 25 % from the power input at operating temperature.The tests for appliances with PTC heating elements and for heating appliances and combined appliances where the heating elements are supplied via a switch mode power supply are carried out at a voltage corresponding to the specified power input.When a power input greater than the rated power input is specified, the factor for multiplying the voltage is equal to the square root of the factor for multiplying the power input.If class 0I appliances or class I appliances have accessible metal parts that are not earthed and are not separated from live parts by an intermediate metal part that is earthed, such parts are checked for compliance with the appropriate requirements specified for class II construction.If class 0I appliances or class I appliances have accessible non-metallic parts, such parts are checked for compliance with the appropriate requirements specified for class II construction unless these parts are separated from live parts by an intermediate metal part that is earthed.NOTE Guidance is given in Annex P for enhanced requirements that may be used to ensure an acceptable level of protection against electrical and thermal hazards for particular types of appliances used in an installation without a protective earthing conductor in countries that have warm damp equable climates.If appliances have parts operating at safety extra-low voltage, such parts are checked for compliance with the appropriate requirements specified for class III construction.\u2013 24 \u2013 60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010When testing electronic circuits, the supply is to be free from perturbations from external sources that can influence the results of the tests.Appliances powered by rechargeable batteries are tested in accordance with Annex B.If linear and angular dimensions are specified without a tolerance, ISO 2768-1 is applicable.If a component or part of the appliance has both a self resetting feature and a non- self-resetting feature and if the non-self-resetting feature is not required in order to comply with the standard, then appliances incorporating such a component or part shall be tested with the non-self-resetting feature rendered inoperative.ClassificationAppliances shall be of one of the following classes with respect to protection against electric shock:class 0, class 0I, class I, class II, class III.Compliance is checked by inspection and by the relevant tests.Appliances shall have the appropriate degree of protection against harmful ingress of water.Compliance is checked by inspection and by the relevant tests.NOTE The degrees of protection against harmful ingress of water are given in IEC 60529.Marking and instructionsAppliances shall be marked with therated voltage or rated voltage range in volts;symbol for nature of supply, unless the rated frequency is marked;rated power input in watts or rated current in amperes;name, trade mark or identification mark of the manufacturer or responsible vendor;model or type reference;symbol IEC 60417-5172 (2003-02) for class II appliances only;IP number according to degree of protection against ingress of water, other than IPX0;symbol IEC 60417-5180 (2003-02), for class  III appliances. This marking  is not necessary for appliances that are operated only by batteries  (primary batteries  or secondary batteries that are recharged outside of the appliance).NOTE 1 The first numeral of the IP number need not be marked on the appliance.NOTE 2 Additional markings are allowed provided they do not give rise to misunderstanding.NOTE 3 If components are marked separately, the marking of the appliance and that of the components is to be such that there can be no doubt with regard to the marking of the appliance itself.NOTE 4 If the appliance is marked with rated pressure, the units used may be bars but only together with pascals and placed in brackets.60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010 \u2013 25 \u2013The enclosure of electrically-operated water valves incorporated in external hose-sets for connection of an appliance to the water mains shall be marked with symbol IEC 60417-5036 (2002-10) if their working voltage exceeds extra-low voltage.Compliance is checked by inspection.Stationary appliances for multiple supply shall be marked with the substance of the following:Warning: Before obtaining access to terminals, all supply circuits must be disconnected.This warning shall be placed in the vicinity of the terminal cover.Compliance is checked by inspection.Appliances having  a range  of rated  values  and which can be operated without adjustment throughout the range shall be marked with the lower and upper limits of the range separated by a hyphen.NOTE 1 Example: 115-230 V: The appliance is suitable for any value within the marked range (a curling iron with a PTC heating element or an appliance incorporating an input switch mode power supply).Appliances having different rated values and which have to be adjusted for use at a particular value by the user or installer shall be marked with the different values separated by an oblique stroke.NOTE 2 Example: 115/230 V: The appliance is only suitable for the marked values (a shaver with a selector switch).NOTE 3 This requirement is also applicable to appliances with provision for connection to both single-phase and multi-phase supplies.Example: 230 V/400 V: The appliance is only suitable for the voltage values indicated, 230 V being for single- phase operation and 400 V for three-phase operation (a dishwasher with terminals for both supplies).Compliance is checked by inspection.If the appliance can be adjusted for different rated voltages, the voltage to which the appliance is adjusted shall be clearly discernible. If frequent changes in voltage setting are not required, this requirement is considered to  be met if the rated voltage to which the appliance is to be adjusted can be determined from a wiring diagram fixed to the appliance.NOTE The wiring diagram may be on the inside of a cover that has to be removed to connect the supply conductors. It is not to be on a label loosely attached to the appliance.Compliance is checked by inspection.For appliances marked with more than one rated voltage or with one or more rated voltage ranges, the rated power input or rated current for each of these voltages or ranges shall be marked. However, if the difference between the limits of a rated voltage range does not exceed 10 % of the arithmetic mean value of the range, the marking for rated power input or rated current may be related to the arithmetic mean value of the range.The upper and lower limits of the rated power input or rated current shall be marked on the appliance so that the relation between input and voltage is clear.Compliance is checked by inspection.When symbols are used, they shall be as follows\u2013 26 \u2013 60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010[symbol IEC 60417- 5031(2002-10)]direct current[symbol IEC 60417- 5032(2002-10)]alternating current3                [symbol IEC 60417- 5032-1(2002-10)]three-phase alternating current3N            [symbol IEC 60417- 5032-2(2002-10)]three-phase alternating current with neutral[symbol IEC 60417- 5016(2002-10)]fuse-linkNOTE 1 The rated current of the fuse link may be indicated in association with this symbol.time-lag miniature fuse-link  where X is the symbol  for the time/current characteristic as given in IEC 60127[symbol IEC 60417- 5019(2006-08)][symbol IEC 60417- 5018(2006-10)][symbol IEC 60417- 5172(2003-02)][symbol IEC 60417- 5012(2002-10)]protective earthfunctional earthingclass II equipmentlampNOTE 2 The rated wattage of the lamp may be indicated in association with this symbol.[symbol ISO 7000-0434(2004-01)]caution[symbol ISO 7000-0790(2004-01)]read operator's manual[symbol IEC 60417- 5021(2002-10)]equipotentiality[symbol IEC 60417-5036(2002-10)]dangerous voltage[symbol IEC 60417-5180(2003-02)]Class III applianceThe symbol for nature of supply shall be placed next to the marking for rated voltage.60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010 \u2013 27 \u2013The symbol for class II appliances shall be placed so that it will be obvious that it is a part of the technical information and is unlikely to be confused with any other marking.Units of physical quantities and their symbols shall be those of the international standardized system.NOTE 3 Additional symbols are allowed provided that they do not give rise to misunderstanding.

It is repositioned before each tightening.The test is carried out by means of a suitable screwdriver, spanner or key and by applying a torque as shown in Table 14.Column I is applicable for metal screws without heads if the screw does not protrude from the hole when tightened.Column II is applicablefor other metal screws and for nuts;for screws of insulating materialhaving a hexagonal head with the dimension across flats exceeding the overall thread diameter;with a cylindrical head and a socket for a key, the socket having a cross-corner dimension exceeding the overall thread diameter;with a head having a slot or cross-slots, the length of which exceeds 1,5 times the overall thread diameter.Column III is applicable for other screws of insulating material.Table 14 \u2013 Torque for testing screws and nutsNominal diameter of screw (outer thread diameter)mmTorqueNmIIIIII\u22642,80,20,40,4>2,8and\u22643,00,250,50,5>3,0and\u22643,20,30,60,5>3,2and\u22643,60,40,80,6>3,6and\u22644,10,71,20,6>4,1and\u22644,70,81,80,9>4,7and\u22645,30,82,01,0>5,3\u20132,51,25No damage impairing the further use of the fixings or connections shall occur.Electrical connections and connections providing earthing continuity shall  be constructed  so that  contact  pressure is not transmitted  through non-ceramic insulating\u2013 88 \u2013 60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010material that is liable to shrink or to distort unless there is sufficient resiliency in the metallic parts to compensate for any possible shrinkage or distortion of the insulating material.This requirement does not apply to electrical connections in circuits of appliances for which30.2.2 is applicable and that carry a current not exceeding 0,5 A;30.2.3 is applicable and that carry a current not exceeding 0,2 A.Compliance is checked by inspection.Space-threaded (sheet metal) screws shall only be used for electrical connections if they clamp the parts together.Thread-cutting (self-tapping) screws and thread rolling screws shall only be used for electrical connections if they generate a full form standard machine screw thread. However, thread- cutting (self-tapping) screws shall not be used if they are likely to be operated by the user or installer.Thread-cutting, thread rolling and space-threaded screws may be used in connections providing earthing continuity provided it is not necessary to disturb the connectionin normal use,during user maintenance,when replacing a supply cord having a type X attachment, orduring installation.At least two screws must be used for each connection providing earthing continuity, unless the screw forms a thread having a length of at least half the diameter of the screw.Compliance is checked by inspection.Screws and nuts that make a mechanical connection between different parts of the appliance shall be secured against loosening if they also make electrical connections or connections providing earthing continuity. This requirement does not apply to screws in the earthing circuit if at least two screws are used for the connection or if an alternative earthing circuit is provided.NOTE 1 Spring washers, lock washers and crown type locks as part of the screw head are means that may provide satisfactory security.NOTE 2 Sealing compound that softens on heating provides satisfactory security only for screw connections not subject to torsion in normal use.Rivets used for electrical connections or for connections providing earthing continuity shall be secured against loosening if these connections are subject to torsion in normal use.NOTE 3 This requirement does not imply that more than one rivet is necessary for providing earthing continuity. NOTE 4 A non-circular shank or an appropriate notch may be sufficient.Compliance is checked by inspection and by manual test.", "Appliances shall be constructed so that the clearances, creepage distances and solid insulation are adequate to withstand the electrical stresses to which the appliance is liable to be subjected.60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010 \u2013 89 \u2013Compliance is checked by the requirements and tests of 29.1 to 29.3.If coatings are used on printed circuit boards to protect the microenvironment (type 1 protection) or to provide  basic  insulation  (type  2 protection),  Annex J applies.  The microenvironment is pollution degree 1 under type 1 protection. For type 2 protection, the spacing between the conductors before the protection is applied shall not be less than the values as specified in Table 1 of IEC 60664-3. These values apply to functional insulation, basic insulation, supplementary insulation as well as reinforced insulation.NOTE 1 The requirements and tests are based on IEC 60664-1 from which further information can be obtained.NOTE 2 The assessment of clearances, creepage distances and solid insulation has to be carried out separately.Clearances shall not be less than the values specified in Table 16, taking into account the rated impulse voltage for the overvoltage categories of Table 15, unless, for basic insulation and functional insulation, they comply with the impulse voltage test of Clause 14. However, if the construction is such that the distances could be affected by wear, by distortion, by movement of the parts or during assembly, the clearances for rated impulse voltages of 1 500 V and above are increased by 0,5 mm and the impulse voltage test is not applicable.The impulse voltage test is not applicable when the microenvironment is pollution degree 3 or for basic insulation of class 0 appliances and class 0I appliances.NOTE 1 Examples of constructions for which the test may be applicable are those having rigid parts or parts located by mouldings.Examples of constructions in which distances are likely to be affected are those involving soldering, snap-on and screw terminals and clearances from motor windings.Appliances are in overvoltage category II.NOTE 2 Annex K gives information regarding overvoltage categories.Table 15 \u2013 Rated impulse  voltageRated voltageVRated impulse voltageVOvervoltage categoryIIIIII\u226450330500800>50 and \u22641508001 5002 500>150 and \u22643001 5002 5004 000NOTE 1 For multi-phase appliances, the line to neutral or line to earth voltage is used for rated voltage.NOTE 2 The  values  are  based on  the assumption that  the appliance will  not  generate higher overvoltages than  those specified. If higher overvoltages are generated, the clearances have to be increased accordingly.\u2013 90 \u2013 60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010Table 16 \u2013 Minimum clearancesRated impulse voltageVMinimum clearance amm3300,5 b, c, d5000,5 b, c, d8000,5 b, c, d1 500c0,52 5001,54 0003,06 0005,58 0008,010 00011,0a The distances specified apply only to clearances in air.b The smaller clearances specified in  IEC 60664-1  have  not been adopted for practical reasons, such as mass-production tolerances.c This value is increased to 0,8 mm for pollution degree 3.d For  tracks of  printed circuit boards  this  value is  reduced to 0,2 mm for pollution degree 1 and pollution degree 2.Compliance is checked by inspection and by measurement.Parts, such as hexagonal nuts that can be tightened to different positions during assembly, and movable parts are placed in the most unfavourable position.A force is applied to bare conductors, other than those of heating elements, and accessible surfaces to try to reduce clearances when making the measurement. The force is2 N, for bare conductors;30 N, for accessible surfaces.The force is applied by means of test probe B of IEC 61032. Apertures are assumed to be covered by a piece of flat metal.NOTE 3 The way in which clearances are measured is specified in IEC 60664-1. NOTE 4 The procedure for assessing clearances is given in Annex L.NOTE 5 For appliances intended for use at altitudes exceeding 2 000 m, the altitude correction factors forclearances specified in Table A.2 of IEC 60664-1 should be taken into account.The clearances of basic insulation shall be sufficient to withstand the overvoltages likely to occur during use, taking into account the rated impulse voltage. The values of Table 16, or the impulse voltage test of Clause 14, are applicable.NOTE The overvoltages may be derived from external sources or due to switching.The clearance at the terminals of tubular sheathed heating elements may be reduced to 1,0 mm if the microenvironment is pollution degree 1.Lacquered conductors of windings are considered to be bare conductors.Compliance is checked by measurement.60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010 \u2013 91 \u2013Clearances of supplementary insulation shall be not less than those specified forbasic insulation in Table 16.Compliance is checked by measurement.Clearances of reinforced insulation shall be not less than those specified for basic insulation in Table 16, using the next higher step for rated impulse voltage as a reference.Compliance is checked  by measurement.  For double  insulation, when there  is no intermediate conductive part between the basic insulation and supplementary insulation, clearances are measured between live parts and the accessible surface, and the insulation system is treated as reinforced insulation as shown in Figure 11.The clearances for functional insulation are the largest values determined fromTable 16 based on the rated impulse voltage;Table F.7a in IEC 60664-1 based on the steady-state voltage or recurring peak voltage expected to occur across it, if the frequency of the steady-state voltage or recurring peak voltage does not exceeds 30 kHz;Clause 4 of IEC 60664-4 based on the steady-state voltage or recurring peak  voltage expected to occur across it, if the frequency of the steady-state voltage or recurring peak voltage exceeds 30 kHz.If the values of Table 16 are largest, the impulse voltage test of Clause 14 may be applied instead unless the microenvironment is pollution degree 3 or the construction is such that the distances could be affected by wear, by distortion, by movement of the parts or during assembly.However, clearances are not specified if  the appliance complies with Clause 19 with thefunctional insulation short-circuited.Lacquered conductors of windings  are considered to be bare conductors. However,clearances at crossover points are not measured.The clearance between surfaces of PTC heating elements may be reduced to 1 mm.Compliance is checked by measurement and by a test if necessary.For appliances having higher working voltages than rated voltage, for example on the secondary side of a step-up transformer, or if there is a resonant voltage, the clearances for basic insulation are the largest values determined fromTable 16 based on the rated impulse voltage;Table F.7a in IEC 60664-1 based on the steady-state voltage or recurring peak voltage expected to occur across it, if the frequency of the steady-state voltage or recurring peak voltage does not exceed 30 kHz;Clause 4 of IEC 60664-4 based on the steady-state voltage or recurring peak voltage expected to occur across it, if the frequency of the steady-state voltage or recurring peak voltage exceeds 30 kHz.NOTE 1 Clearances for intermediate values of Table 16 may be determined by interpolation.If the clearances applied for basic insulation are selected from Table F.7a of IEC 60664-1 or Clause 4 of IEC 60664-4, then the clearances of supplementary insulation shall be not less than those specified for basic insulation.\u2013 92 \u2013 60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010If the clearances applied for basic insulation are selected from Table F.7a of IEC 60664-1, then the clearances of reinforced  insulation shall  be dimensioned as specified in Table F.7a to withstand 160 % of the withstand voltage required for basic insulation.If the clearances applied for basic insulation are selected from Clause 4 of IEC 60664-4, then the clearances of reinforced insulation shall be twice the value required for basic insulation.If the secondary winding of a step-down transformer is earthed, or if there is an earthed screen between the primary and secondary windings, clearances of basic insulation on the secondary side shall be not less than those specified in Table 16, using the next lower step for rated impulse voltage as a reference.NOTE 2 The use of an isolating transformer without an earthed protective screen or earthed secondary does not allow a reduction in the rated impulse voltage.For circuits supplied with a voltage lower than rated voltage, for example on the secondary side of a transformer, clearances of functional insulation are based on the working voltage, which is used as the rated voltage in Table 15.Compliance is checked by measurement.Appliances shall be constructed so that creepage distances are not less than those appropriate for the working voltage, taking into account the material group and the pollution degree.NOTE 1 The working voltage for parts connected to the neutral is the same as for parts connected to the phase and this is the working voltage for basic insulation.Pollution degree 2 applies unlessprecautions have been taken to protect the insulation, in which case pollution degree 1 applies;the insulation is subjected to conductive pollution, in which case pollution degree 3 applies.NOTE 2 An explanation of pollution degree is given in Annex M.Compliance is checked by measurement.NOTE 3 The way in which creepage distances are measured is specified in IEC 60664-1.Parts such as hexagonal nuts that can be tightened to different positions during assembly, and movable parts are placed in the most unfavourable position.A force is applied to bare conductors, other than those of heating elements, and accessible surfaces to try to reduce creepage distances when making the measurement. The force is2 N, for bare conductors;30 N, for accessible surfaces.The force is applied by means of test probe B of IEC 61032.The relationship between the material group and the comparative tracking index (CTI) values, as given in Subclause 4.8.1.3 of IEC 60664-1, is as follows:material group I: 600 \u2264 CTI;material group II: 400 \u2264 CTI < 600;60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010 \u2013 93 \u2013material group IIIa: 175 \u2264 CTI < 400;material group IIIb: 100 \u2264 CTI < 175.These CTI values are obtained in accordance with IEC 60112 using solution A. If the CTI value of the material is unknown, a proof tracking index (PTI) test in accordance with Annex N is carried out at the CTI values specified, in order to establish the material group.NOTE 4 The test for comparative tracking index (CTI) in accordance with IEC 60112 is designed to compare the performance of various insulating materials under test conditions, namely drops of an aqueous contaminant falling on a horizontal surface leading to electrolytic conduction. It gives a qualitative comparison but in the case of insulating materials having a tendency to form tracks, it can also give a quantitative comparison, namely the comparative tracking index.NOTE 5 The procedure for assessing creepage distances is given in Annex L.In a double insulation system, the working voltage for both the basic insulation and supplementary insulation is taken as the working voltage across the complete double insulation system. It is not divided according to thickness and dielectric constants of the basic insulation and supplementary insulation.Creepage distances of basic insulation shall not be less than those specified in Table 17. However, if the working voltage is periodic and has a frequency that exceeds 30 kHz, the creepage distances shall also be determined from Table 2 of IEC 60664-4. These values shall be used instead if they exceed the values in Table 17.Except for pollution degree 1, if the test of Clause 14 has been used to check a particular clearance, the corresponding creepage distance shall not be less than the minimum dimension specified for the clearance of Table 16.\u2013 94 \u2013 60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010Table 17 \u2013  Minimum creepage distances for basic insulationWorking voltageVCreepage distancemmPollution degree123Material groupMaterial groupIIIIIIa/IIIbIIIIIIa/IIIb a\u2264 50125250400500>630 and \u2264800>800 and \u22641 000>1 000 and \u22641 250>1 250 and \u22641 600>1 600 and \u22642 000>2 000 and \u22642 500>2 500 and \u22643 200>3 200 and \u22644 000>4 000 and \u22645 000>5 000 and \u22646 300>6 300 and \u22648 000>8 000 and \u226410 000>10 000 and \u226412 5000,180,280,561,01,31,82,43,24,25,67,510,012,516,020,025,032,040,00,60,751,252,02,53,24,05,06,38,010,012,516,020,025,032,040,050,00,851,051,82,83,64,55,67,19,011,014,018,022,028,036,045,056,071,01,21,52,54,05,06,38,010,012,516,020,025,032,040,050,063,080,0100,01,51,93,25,06,38,010,012,516,020,025,032,040,050,063,080,0100,0125,01,72,13,65,67,19,011,014,018,022,028,036,045,056,071,090,0110,0140,01,92,44,06,38,010,012,516,020,025,032,040,050,063,080,0100,0125,0160,0NOTE 1 Lacquered conductors of windings are considered to be bare conductors, but creepage distancesneed not be greater than the associated clearance specified in Table 16 taking into account 29.1.1.NOTE 2 For glass, ceramics and other inorganic insulating  materials  that  do not  track,  creepage  distances need not be greater than the associated clearance.NOTE 3 Except for circuits on the secondary side of an isolating transformer, the working voltage is considered to be not less than the rated voltage of the appliance.NOTE 4   For working voltages >  50  V  and \u2264  630 V, if  the  voltage is  not specified in the  table, the values   of creepage distances may be found by interpolation.a Material group IIIb is allowed if the working voltage does not exceed 50 V.Compliance is checked by measurement.Creepage distances of supplementary insulation shall be at least those specified for basic insulation in Table 17 or Table 2 of IEC 60664-4, as applicable.NOTE Notes 1 and 2 of Table 17 do not apply.Compliance is checked by measurement.Creepage distances of reinforced insulation shall  be at least  double those specified for basic insulation in Table 17 or Table 2 of IEC 60664-4, as applicable.NOTE Notes 1 and 2 of Table 17 do not apply.Compliance is checked by measurement.60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010 \u2013 95 \u2013Creepage distances of functional insulation shall be not less than those specified in Table 18.

They are normally carried out on the complete appliance after assembly but the manufacturer may perform the tests at an appropriate stage during production, provided that later manufacturing processes do not affect the results.NOTE Components are not subjected to these tests if they have been previously subjected to routine tests during their manufacture.The manufacturer may use a different routine test procedure provided that the level of safety is equivalent to that provided by the tests specified in this annex.These tests are the minimum considered necessary to cover essential safety aspects. It is the manufacturer\u2019s responsibility to decide if additional routine tests are necessary. It may be determined from engineering considerations that some of the tests are impracticable or inappropriate and therefore need not be carried out.If a product fails any of the tests, it is to be retested after rework or adjustment.Earth continuity testA current of at least 10 A, derived from a source having a no-load voltage not exceeding 12 V (a.c. or d.c.), is passed between each of the accessible earthed metal parts andfor class 0I appliances, and for class I appliances intended to be permanently connected to fixed wiring, the earthing terminal;for other class I appliances,the earthing pin or earthing contact of the plug;the earthing pin of the appliance inlet.The voltage drop is measured and the resistance is calculated and shall not exceedfor appliances having a supply cord, 0,2 \u03a9, or 0,1 \u03a9 plus the resistance of the supply cord;\u2013 for other appliances, 0,1 \u03a9.NOTE 1 The test is only carried out for the duration necessary to enable the voltage drop to be measured.NOTE 2 Care is to be taken to ensure that the contact resistance between the tip of the measuring probe and the metal part under test does not influence the test results.Electric strength testThe insulation of the appliance is subjected to a voltage of substantially sinusoidal waveform having a frequency of approximately 50 Hz or 60 Hz for 1 s. The value of the test voltage and the points of application are shown in Table A.1.\u2013 116 \u2013 60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010Table A.1 \u2013 Test voltagesPoints of applicationTest voltageVClass 0 appliances, Class 0I appliances,Class I appliances and Class II appliancesClass III appliancesRated voltage400\u2013\u2264150 V>150 VBetween live parts andaccessible metal parts separated from live parts by8002 0001 0002 500a This test is not applicable for class 0 appliances.b For class 0I appliances and class I appliances, this test need not be carried out on  parts  of  class  II  construction if the test is considered to be inappropriate.basic insulation onlydouble or reinforced insulation a, bNOTE 1 It may be necessary for the appliance to be in operation during the test to ensure that the test voltage is applied to all relevant insulation, for example, heating elements controlled by a relay.No breakdown shall occur. Breakdown is assumed to occur when the current in the test circuit exceeds 5 mA. However, this limit may be increased up to 30 mA for appliances with a high leakage current.NOTE 2 The circuit used for the test incorporates a current sensing device that trips when the current exceeds the limit.NOTE 3 The high voltage transformer is to be capable of maintaining the specified voltage at the limiting current.NOTE 4 Instead of being subjected to an a.c. voltage, the insulation may be subjected to a d.c. voltage of 1,5 times the value shown in the table.

The macro- environment, however, has to be taken into account when considering the microenvironment.Means may be provided to reduce pollution at the insulation under consideration by effective use of enclosures, encapsulation or hermetic sealing. Such means to reduce pollution may not be effective when the equipment is subjected to condensation or if in normal use, it generates pollutants itself.Small clearances can be bridged completely by solid particles, dust and water and therefore minimum clearances are specified where pollution may be present in the microenvironment.NOTE 1 Pollution will become conductive in the presence of humidity. Pollution caused by contaminated water, soot, metal or carbon dust is inherently conductive.NOTE 2 Conductive pollution by ionized gases and metallic depositions occur only in specific instances, for example in arc chambers of switchgear or controlgear and is not covered by IEC 60664-1.Degrees of pollution in the microenvironmentFor the purpose of evaluating creepage distances, the following four degrees of pollution in the microenvironment are established:pollution degree 1: no pollution or only dry, non-conductive pollution occurs. The pollution has no influence;pollution degree 2: only non-conductive pollution occurs, except that occasionally a temporary conductivity caused by condensation is to be expected;pollution degree 3: conductive pollution occurs or dry non-conductive pollution occurs that becomes conductive due to condensation that is to be expected;pollution degree 4: the pollution generates persistent conductivity caused by conductive dust or by rain or snow.NOTE 3 Pollution degree 4 is not applicable to appliances.60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010 \u2013 137 \u2013Annex N(normative)Proof tracking testThe proof tracking test is carried out in accordance with IEC 60112 with the following modifications.7 Test apparatus7.3 Test solutionsTest solution A is used.Determination of proof tracking index (PTI)ProcedureModification:The proof voltage is 100 V, 175 V, 400 V or 600 V, as appropriate.

Overvoltage category is a numeral defining a transient overvoltage condition.Equipment of overvoltage category IV is for use at the origin of the installation.NOTE 1 Examples of such equipment are electricity meters and primary overcurrent protection equipment.Equipment of overvoltage category III is equipment in fixed installations and for cases where the reliability and the availability of the equipment is subject to special requirements.NOTE 2 Examples of such equipment are switches in the fixed installation and equipment for industrial use with permanent connection to the fixed installation.Equipment of overvoltage category II is energy consuming equipment to be supplied from the fixed installation.NOTE 3 Examples of such equipment are appliances, portable tools and other household and similar loads.If such equipment  is subjected  to special requirements with regard  to reliability and availability, overvoltage category III applies.Equipment of overvoltage category I is equipment for connection to circuits in which measures are taken to limit transient overvoltages to an appropriately low level.\u2013 132 \u2013 60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010Annex L(informative)Guidance for the measurement of clearances and creepage  distancesWhen measuring clearances, the following applies.The rated voltage and overvoltage category are determined (see Annex K).NOTE 1 In general, appliances are in overvoltage category II.The rated impulse voltage is determined from Table 15.If pollution degree 3 is applicable, or if the appliance is class 0 or class 01, the clearances for basic insulation and functional insulation are measured and compared with the minimum values specified in Table 16. For other cases, the impulse voltage test may be carried out if the rigidity requirements of 29.1 are met, otherwise the values specified in Table 16 apply. However, for functional insulation that is subjected to a steady-state voltage or recurring peak voltage with a frequency not exceeding 30 kHz, the clearances are also obtained from Table F.7a in IEC 60664-1 or if the frequency exceeds 30 kHz, Clause 4 in IEC 60664-4. The larger of the values so obtained is applied if they exceed the minimum values specified in Table 16.Clearances of supplementary insulation and reinforced insulation are measured and compared with the minimum values specified in Table 16.NOTE 2 Special considerations apply for clearances subjected to higher working voltages than rated voltage.

A particular creepage distance is then compared with the corresponding clearance of Table 16 and enlarged if necessary in order not to be less than the clearance. For pollution degree 1, the reduced clearance based on the impulse voltage test can be used. However, the creepage distance can not be less than the values of Table 17.The creepage distances of functional insulation are measured and compared with the minimum values specified in Table 18 or for periodic working voltages exceeding 30 kHz Table 2 of IEC 60664-4.The creepage distances of reinforced insulation are measured and compared with twice the minimum values specified in Table 17.NOTE The sequence for determining creepage distances is shown in Figure L.2.60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010 \u2013 135 \u2013Working voltageMaterial groupPollution degreeBasic insulation (Table 17 or Table 2 in IEC 60664-4as applicable)Supplementary insulation(as obtained for basic insulation from  Table 17 or Table 2 inIEC 60664-4 asapplicable)Functional insulation (larger of Table 18 or for periodic working voltages > 30 kHz in  Table 2 ofIEC 60664-4)Reinforced insulation (29.2.3)Impulse voltage test on clearanceClearancefrom Table 16Pollution degree 2, 3Pollution degree 1Clearancefrom Table 16Creepage distanceFigure L.2 \u2013 Sequence for the determination of creepage distancesIEC 561/01\u2013 136 \u2013 60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010Annex M(normative)Pollution degreeThe following information on pollution degrees is extracted from IEC 60664-1.PollutionThe microenvironment determines the effect of pollution on the insulation. The macro- environment, however, has to be taken into account when considering the microenvironment.Means may be provided to reduce pollution at the insulation under consideration by effective use of enclosures, encapsulation or hermetic sealing. Such means to reduce pollution may not be effective when the equipment is subjected to condensation or if in normal use, it generates pollutants itself.Small clearances can be bridged completely by solid particles, dust and water and therefore minimum clearances are specified where pollution may be present in the microenvironment.NOTE 1 Pollution will become conductive in the presence of humidity. Pollution caused by contaminated water, soot, metal or carbon dust is inherently conductive.NOTE 2 Conductive pollution by ionized gases and metallic depositions occur only in specific instances, for example in arc chambers of switchgear or controlgear and is not covered by IEC 60664-1.Degrees of pollution in the microenvironmentFor the purpose of evaluating creepage distances, the following four degrees of pollution in the microenvironment are established:pollution degree 1: no pollution or only dry, non-conductive pollution occurs. The pollution has no influence;pollution degree 2: only non-conductive pollution occurs, except that occasionally a temporary conductivity caused by condensation is to be expected;pollution degree 3: conductive pollution occurs or dry non-conductive pollution occurs that becomes conductive due to condensation that is to be expected;pollution degree 4: the pollution generates persistent conductivity caused by conductive dust or by rain or snow.NOTE 3 Pollution degree 4 is not applicable to appliances.60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010 \u2013 137 \u2013Annex N(normative)Proof tracking testThe proof tracking test is carried out in accordance with IEC 60112 with the following modifications.7 Test apparatus7.3 Test solutionsTest solution A is used.Determination of proof tracking index (PTI)ProcedureModification:The proof voltage is 100 V, 175 V, 400 V or 600 V, as appropriate.

incorporating measures to control the fault/error conditions specified ", "The following information on pollution degrees is extracted from IEC 60664-1.PollutionThe microenvironment determines the effect of pollution on the insulation. The macro- environment, however, has to be taken into account when considering the microenvironment.Means may be provided to reduce pollution at the insulation under consideration by effective use of enclosures, encapsulation or hermetic sealing. Such means to reduce pollution may not be effective when the equipment is subjected to condensation or if in normal use, it generates pollutants itself.Small clearances can be bridged completely by solid particles, dust and water and therefore minimum clearances are specified where pollution may be present in the microenvironment.NOTE 1 Pollution will become conductive in the presence of humidity. Pollution caused by contaminated water, soot, metal or carbon dust is inherently conductive.NOTE 2 Conductive pollution by ionized gases and metallic depositions occur only in specific instances, for example in arc chambers of switchgear or controlgear and is not covered by IEC 60664-1.Degrees of pollution in the microenvironmentFor the purpose of evaluating creepage distances, the following four degrees of pollution in the microenvironment are established:pollution degree 1: no pollution or only dry, non-conductive pollution occurs. The pollution has no influence;pollution degree 2: only non-conductive pollution occurs, except that occasionally a temporary conductivity caused by condensation is to be expected;pollution degree 3: conductive pollution occurs or dry non-conductive pollution occurs that becomes conductive due to condensation that is to be expected;pollution degree 4: the pollution generates persistent conductivity caused by conductive dust or by rain or snow.NOTE 3 Pollution degree 4 is not applicable to appliances.60335-1 \u00a9 IEC:2010 \u2013 137 \u2013", "The proof tracking test is carried out in accordance with IEC 60112 with the following modifications.7 Test apparatus7.3 Test solutionsTest solution A is used.Determination of proof tracking index (PTI)ProcedureModification:The proof voltage is 100 V, 175 V, 400 V or 600 V, as appropriate.

Sufficient samples of the product shall be provided to conduct all of the tests required. Products may be tested as a complete assembly or the separate components or sub-assemblies may be tested individually. For test results from components or sub-assemblies to be acceptable, the sum of the tested exposures shall be equal to or greater than the actual exposures of the complete assembly, except for the growth of micro-organisms test, where the tested exposure shall be in the range of 1000 mm 2 /L to 15 000 mm 2 /L. NOTE: Care should be taken in considering the approval of materials that are not in final product form. The performance of materials is affected by the processing conditions, which may influence results of the tests described in this Standard. Any changes in the material formulation, the process of manufacture, the method of application, or the surface area-to-volume ratio in end use could affect the suitability of the product for use in contact with drinking water and re-testing may be required. 4.2 Range of product sizes Where a manufacturer produces a complete range of product sizes of the same material composition, tests on the greatest surface area-to-volume ratio product shall qualify the remainder of the range, provided that the same manufacturing conditions and processes are used for the complete range of products. 4.3   Product exposure Wherever possible, samples of the product shall be tested by in-the-product exposure (see Paragraph A4.1), so that only the surface that is normally wetted in end use is exposed to the test water. Where in-the-product exposure is not possible, or where unfabricated material is being tested, the product surface or a representative sample of the material surface shall be tested by immersion exposure (see Paragraph A4.2). The ratio of exposed surface area to extractant water volume for immersion exposure testing shall be equal to (within 5%) or greater than the surface area-to-volume ratio in the intended end use, and shall not be less than 1000 mm2 /L. Where testing for the growth of micro-organisms, the ratio shall be in the range 22 21000 mm /L to 15 000 mm /L. Where the end-use exposure is greater than 15 000 mm /L, the test result shall be based on a testing exposure of 15 000 mm 2 /L and no scaling factor shall be applied to this result. Where a product has multiple non-metallic components, the non-metallic wetted components shall be tested at the end-use exposure, with the exception that end-of-line fittings shall be tested at an exposure for each component in contact with 250 mL of water. The MDOD result shall be the average of results for individual components.", "5.1   General Scaling factors are normally specified in the relevant product Standard. The discussion below applies to situations in which this is not the case. Flexible hoses are tested as end-of-line fittings unless otherwise specified in the relevant product Standard. A scaling factor is generally not applicable to in-the-product testing (e.g. the testing of pipe). In this method of exposure, the ratio of the exposed surface area to the extractant water volume will in most cases be equal to the surface area-to-volume ratio in end use (i.e. a scaling factor of 1). An exception applies in certain cases of in-the-product testing, where in end use the internal surface of the product is effectively in contact with a substantially larger volume of water than in the test. Examples of such products are valves and fittings connected into water supply pipelines. A further exception applies in the testing of end-of-line-fittings such as taps and their components, where in the end-use situation the extract contained in the fitting is effectively diluted before consumption. Similarly, the use of a composite extract in the metals extraction test for end-of-line fittings has the effect of providing an inbuilt scaling factor. In immersion exposure testing, the selected surface-area-to-volume ratio in the test can be greater than in the intended end use. Where this is the case, a scaling factor having a value of less than 1 may be applied in the evaluation of the test result. For end-of-line fittings requiring the total immersion procedure, the fitting is tested in 250 mL of test water. In addition, the testing exposure shall be not less than 1000 mm 2 /L. Scaling factors cannot be applied to qualify products for end-use surface area-to-volume ratios higher than the test ratio, i.e. the scaling factor cannot be greater than 1. Scaling factors can be used only to qualify products for use at surface area-to-volume ratios lower than the test ratio. 5.2   Determination of scaling factors Where a scaling factor is applied in either immersion exposure testing or in-the-product testing, the value of this scaling factor will have been agreed between the manufacturer and the testing laboratory. Where product certification is required, the agreed scaling factor needs to be acceptable to the certifying body. The scaling factor specified shall be in the range 0.01 to 1.0 and shall apply to all tests. The test report shall include the value and method of derivation of the scaling factor. NOTE: Examples of the method of scaling factor calculation in some typical product applications are given in Appendix B.  In the case of domestic plumbing fittings, a scaling factor based on the layout in Figure B1 will apply, unless the manufacturer presents another valid approach. 5.3 Application of scaling factors (see Paragraph B3 Example 1) The scaling factor shall be applied by sample size selection (to produce the surface area-tovolume ratio applicable to the end-use situation) and/or by the application of the scaling factor to each test. Where used for a test, the scaling factor shall be applied as follows: (a) Taste The extract is diluted with fresh extractant water in proportion to the scaling factor. (b) Appearance The extract is diluted in proportion to the scaling factor or, alternatively, the concentration of each colour and/or turbidity value in the extract is multiplied by the scaling factor. (c) Growth of micro-organisms The mean dissolved oxygen difference is multiplied by the scaling factor. (d) Cytotoxic and mutagenic activity The extract is diluted with fresh extractant water in proportion to the scaling factor. (e) Extraction of metals The extract is diluted with fresh extractant water in proportion to the scaling factor or, alternatively, the concentration of each metal in the extract is multiplied by the scaling factor. 5.4 Restrictions on the use of scaling factors The uncertainty of measurement in laboratory testing will increase as the amount of dilution of the extract increases. As a practical limit, the maximum allowable dilution of the extract prior to assessment for taste, appearance, cytotoxic and mutagenic activity, and extraction of metals (Appendices C, D, F, G and H) shall not exceed 1 part extract to 99 parts fresh extractant water. Similarly, a scaling factor applied to the test result in the appearance test (see Clause 5.3(b)) or the extraction of metals test (see Clause 5.3(e)) shall not have a value of less than 0.01. In the growth of micro-organisms test (see Clause 5.3(c)), the scaling factor applied to the test result shall not have a value of less than 0.33. NOTE: Where a scaling factor of less than 0.33 is required for the growth of micro-organisms test, adjustment of the surface area-to-volume ratio is necessary prior to testing.", "6.1   General Products for use in contact with drinking water shall be subjected to tests for taste, appearance, growth of aquatic micro-organisms, cytotoxicity, mutagenicity and extraction of metals, dependent on whether the type of product is in-line, end-of-line or hot water system, in accordance with Table 1 and the methods given in Appendices C to K, as appropriate. The results of these tests shall comply with the criteria set out below. Testing shall be undertaken unless specifically excluded by the relevant product standard. NOTE: As experience in the use of this Standard increases, a list of products exempt from testing may be developed. NOTES: 1 \u2018Metallic pipes and fittings\u2019 are defined as those products that contain only wetted metallic components as part of the complete assembly. 2 The microbial test is undertaken for products that contain non-metallic wetted components. Testing of the products is usually conducted at 30\u00b0C and covers products that operate at less than 40\u00b0C (see Appendix E). 3 N/A: Test is not required. 6.2 Taste of water extract When the product is tested in accordance with Appendix C, if a reportable taste is detected by any member of the taste panel in the first dilution of the first and/or seventh chlorinated or unchlorinated extract, the product shall be deemed unsuitable for contact with drinking water unless two further samples are examined and each panellist reports no taste in the first dilution of the final (i.e. seventh) chlorinated or unchlorinated extract from these samples. 6.3   Appearance of water extract When the product is tested in accordance with Appendix D, the increase in true colour and turbidity of the water in the first extract shall be less than five Hazen Units (HU) and 0.5 Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTU) respectively. If a single sample does not comply with this requirement after a seventh extract, the product shall be deemed unsuitable for contact with drinking water unless three further samples are examined and the mean colour and turbidity of their final (i.e. seventh) extracts are not increased by more than 5 HU or 0.5 NTU respectively. 6.4   Growth of aquatic micro-organisms When the product is tested in accordance with Appendix E, the mean dissolved oxygen difference (MDOD) shall be less than or equal to 2.4 mg/L. If a single sample of a product gives an MDOD in the range 1.7 mg/L to 2.9 mg/L inclusive, two further samples of the product shall be examined. If the arithmetic mean of the three MDOD values is greater than 2.4 mg/L, the product shall be deemed unsuitable for contact with drinking water. 6.5 Cytotoxic activity of water extract When the product is tested in accordance with Appendix F, the extract shall not cause a cytotoxic response. If a single sample gives a cytotoxic response, two further samples of the product shall be examined using fresh reagents. 6.6   Mutagenic activity of water extract The product shall be tested in accordance with Appendix G and the test result shall be reported. If a single sample gives a statistically significant result, two further samples shall be extracted using fresh reagents and the reversion test repeated with the same strain of bacterium. A positive result shall be confirmed by testing for mutagenicity of the extract using the alternative micro-organism test system. NOTE: The reliability of the test for mutagenic activity is currently under investigation. Whereas there is still a requirement to report the result of this test, that test result should not at this time form the basis for overall failure of the sample. 6.7   Extraction of metals 6.7.1 Products in general When the product is tested in accordance with Appendices H to J, the amounts of the specified metals in the first and/or final extracts shall not exceed the limits given in Table 2. NOTE: The limits give in Table 2 are subject to adjustment from time to time. The latest available concentrations should be obtained from the Australian Drinking Water Guidelines (ADWG) and the Drinking Water Standards for New Zealand (DWSNZ). If the limit for any metal is exceeded in the final (seventh) extract from any of the duplicate samples, the product shall be deemed unsuitable for contact with drinking water unless a further three samples are examined and the mean of the specified metals in their final seventh extracts does not exceed the limits specified in Table 2. Where the product tested is applied to a metal fitting, the assessment shall be made on the differences in concentrations of the specified metals between the final extracts and the metal-fitting blank test. Where a cementitious product has been tested, the assessment shall be made on the differences in concentrations of the specified metals between the final extracts and the reagent blank test. 6.7.2 End-of-line fittings A procedure for testing end-of-line fittings for extraction of metals is given in Appendix I. If either of the duplicate samples exceeds the concentration limits specified in Table 2, a further three fresh samples of the product shall be examined. The product shall be deemed to pass the test if the mean of the specified metals for all samples does not exceed the limits given in Table 2.", "Where products are designed for use in hot water installations and the water in contact with the product surfaces meets the definition given in Clause 3.5, products shall be tested in accordance with Appendix J or K. The manufacturer of the product is responsible for nominating the maximum holding temperature of the water contained in the product, within the range 40\u00b0C to 100\u00b0C inclusive.

It is for this reason that this method is concerned with taste alone.C3 PRINCIPLEA sample of the product is exposed to chlorine-free test water for 24 h and the extract is then diluted and assessed by a taste panel. If any panellist reports a taste in the first dilution, the same samples are exposed to the test water for a further six sequential periods, including one 72 h period and concluding with a 24 h period, fresh chlorine-free test water being used for each period.

STANDARD MICROBIOLOGICAL PROCEDURES SHOULD BE FOLLOWED THROUGHOUT.Materials containing organic substances (as ingredients, contaminants or process by- products) that are capable of being utilized by micro-organisms can give rise to a noticeable deterioration in the quality of the water with which they are in contact. This deterioration may manifest itself as a change in the organoleptic, physical or microbiological characteristics of water. Microbial growth may occur in the water or at the material-water interface. The phenomenon is distinct from that of microbial attachment, which can occur on the surface of any type of material. If utilizable substances leach out of the material into the water, the growth will be self-limiting and decline in proportion to the rate of leaching. Growths on such materials have been found to persist for periods from 18 months to three years. Where the utilizable substance is bound within or to the material, growths can persist indefinitely.Materials capable of supporting microbial growth do not give rise to an observable deterioration in water quality in every situation. This is due to the influence of various environmental factors, particularly temperature and the presence of residual chlorine. However, in plumbing systems the water temperature is rarely low enough to inhibit microbial growth, and the low level of residual chlorine present in public water supplies will not exert any appreciable bacteriocidal or bacteriostatic action once the water is within the customer\u2019s piping.Drinking water has been treated to ensure the absence of pathogens that give rise to enteric disease, but it is not sterile. The numbers and types of harmless micro-organisms present in drinking water vary considerably, and the natural flora comprise many strains that are adapted to living in a relatively hostile environment. Such organisms differ in their physiological capacity from strains of the same organism found in other environments or grown in the laboratory. Tests using natural strains of aquatic organisms have given responses that correlate well with the occurrence of problems in practice, whereas the responses of laboratory cultures have not given reliable predictions of the performance of a material in practice.There is no technique, based on growing micro-organisms on or in culture media, that enumerates all the aquatic micro-organisms present in a sample of water. Thus the overall number of micro-organisms can be assessed only by an indirect measurement of their activity. The method of assessing microbial activity in the test system described in this Appendix is the measurement of dissolved oxygen uptake. The organisms that give rise to appreciable microbial growth respire aerobically and exert an influence on the levels of oxygen dissolved in the water in the test systems.", "TEST METHOD\u2014CYTOTOXIC ACTIVITY OF WATER EXTRACT(Normative)F1 SCOPEThis Appendix sets out qualitative and quantitative methods for cytotoxicity testing of all products used in contact with drinking water.F2 PRINCIPLEF2.1 GeneralLicensed to Mr LIM YH on 4 December 2009. 1 user personal user licence only. Storage, distribution or use on network prohibited (10074895).A sample of the product is exposed to test water for 24 h. The exposures are repeated using fresh water for one further 48-hour period, followed by one 72-hour period.An aliquot from each product extract is used in the preparation of a nutrient medium for the growth of mammalian cells.Blank extracts, negative and positive controls are assessed in parallel with the sample extracts. Assessment of cytotoxicity is achieved by comparing identical time points of the product extracts with their relative blanks. Alternatively, evidence of a cytotoxic response is determined when the morphology of the cell line is affected by the sample extracts.F2.2 Qualitative determination of cytotoxicity by microscopyThe morphology of cells grown in the presence of the product extracts is observed and compared to those of the blank extracts.F2.3 Quantitative determination of cytotoxicity by endpoint assayCytotoxicity can be determined quantitatively by measuring cell viability via an endpoint assay. The use of 1-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-3,5-diphenylformazan (MTT) is one such example. In the presence of active cellular mitochondrial reductases, MTT is reduced from the soluble yellow tetrazolium salt into insoluble purple formazan crystals. Dissolving the cells and crystals in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) creates a homogeneous solution, the absorbance of which is measured at 570 nm (reference at 630 nm). Absorbance is directly proportional to cell viability. The cytotoxicity of the extracts is quantified using a cytotoxicity standard curve and quality control standards. These are included to ensure correct performance of the assay.F3 TEST PREMISESBoth procedures shall be carried out only by persons having experience in tissue culture and microscopic examination of cell morphology.NOTES:1 The test should be carried out in a suitable biohazard cabinet.2 The nutrient media used in this test are capable of supporting microbial growth and the cell line is capable of being infected by human viruses.WARNING: AS WELL AS OBSERVING SAFE WORKING PRACTICES, PARTICULAR CARE IS NECESSARY IN HANDLING CONTINUOUS CELL LINES BECAUSE THEY MAY BECOME INFECTED WITH PATHOGENIC VIRUSES AND BACTERIA DURING THE COURSE OF THEIR MANIPULATION.F4 REAGENTS", "TEST METHOD\u2014MUTAGENIC ACTIVITY OF WATER EXTRACT(Normative)G1 SCOPEThis Appendix sets out a method for bacterial mutagenicity testing of leachates from all products used in contact with drinking water.G2 PRINCIPLELicensed to Mr LIM YH on 4 December 2009. 1 user personal user licence only. Storage, distribution or use on network prohibited (10074895).The Ames test is a reverse mutation assay using Salmonella typhimurium. An alternative system uses Escherichia coli. The assay uses a pre-incubation plate incorporation method. A reverse-mutation assay detects mutation in a gene of an amino acid-requiring bacterial strain, the result of which is to produce an amino acid-independent strain. This assay is based on OECD Guidelines 471 and 472 and the Ames test as reviewed by Maron and Ames (1983).*The Salmonella typhimurium histidine (His) reversion system is a microbial assay, which\u2212measures His+to Hisreversion induced by chemicals that cause base changes or frameshiftmutations in the genome of this organism.The Escherichia coli tryptophan (Trp) reversion system is a microbial assay, which\u2212measures Trp+to Trpreversion induced by chemicals that cause mutations in the genomeof this organism.The assay used incorporates a pre-incubation step in which the bacteria are exposed to the test substance with a metabolic activation system prior to addition of top agar and overlaying onto a defined minimal medium agar plate. The assay also uses a direct addition to the top agar overlay where no metabolic activation is attempted. After a suitable period of incubation, revertant colonies are counted and compared with the number of spontaneous revertants in a blank extract control culture. For the purposes of this Standard, separate tests with one of the two systems are used to determine the absence of substances that give rise to a mutagenic response. If a mutagenic response is detected in one system of reverse- mutation assay, confirmation in the other system is required (i.e. if an extract is mutagenic using the Salmonella typhimurium system, mutagenicity is confirmed using a suitable Escherichia coli system and vice versa).G3 TEST PREMISESCultures and media shall be manipulated in a laboratory having a biologically clean atmosphere that is dust free, and the test shall be carried out in an environment that avoids contamination of the bacteria culture. The testing should be carried out in a suitable biohazard cabinet conforming with AS 2567 where appropriate.G4 REAGENTSG4.1 Test waterPrepared as described in Paragraph C5.1.1 except for the testing of cementitious products (see Paragraph A8).* MARON, D.M. and AMES, B.N. \u2018Revised methods for the Salmonella mutagenicity test\u2019.

Where the fitting is in contact with cold and hot water, the method takes into account hot and cold cycles and the transient nature of water temperature. It also uses a scaling factor of less than 1, as the extract contained in the fitting is in practice dispersed into a larger total volume of water when the water is consumed.Licensed to Mr LIM YH on 4 December 2009. 1 user personal user licence only. Storage, distribution or use on network prohibited (10074895).The test for growth of aquatic micro-organisms is undertaken using the extraction procedures described in Appendix E.For methods of analysis of the extracts, refer to the appropriate appendices.I2 PRINCIPLEIn-the-product exposure is used wherever possible for the test extractions (A4.1), so that the sample of the fitting is completely filled with the test water (extractant water) to cover the surface area-to-volume ratio in end use. For Appendices C, D, F and G, at the completion of the appropriate contact period, which may include an initial maximum temperature exposure (for fittings used for the distribution of water that is \u226540\u00b0C), the volume held in the test fitting is collected, and made up to a final volume of 250 mL prior to analysis.Immersion exposure (A4.2) is used for fittings such as tap components that cannot be evaluated by in-the-product exposure and can be installed within 250 mL draw-off of adrinking water delivery point. In such cases, the test fitting is totally immersed in 250 mL2of extractant water at not less than 1000 mm /L test water.Immersion exposure applies also for extraction of metals (see Appendix H) in cases where fittings and components cannot be tested for metals using the test rig (I3.1).The test rig is used to test for extraction of metals (see Appendix H) in end-of-line fittings.The test rig comprises a suitable water storage container and heater (hot tests) connected via a pipe to an isolation valve, which is then connected via a pipe to the test fitting. The extractant water is brought into contact with the fitting materials up to the closing mechanism or, if this does not exist, the outlet end of the fitting, for an extended contact period. This period simulates overnight contact of water with an end-of-line fitting in a domestic situation. After the contact period, aliquots of water are drawn from the fitting over a 3.5 h period and the aliquots combined and tested as a composite test extract for the relevant metals (see Table 2).I3 APPARATUSI3.1 Test rig (for test procedure I6.3)The test rig is constructed of materials shown not to leach materials into the water. The test rig comprises a water storage vessel suitable for containing at least 15 L of extractant water and a connecting valve and pipe. For testing end-of-line fittings for the hot water tests, a suitable method of heating the test water shall be used. A commercial urn, shown not to influence any results, can be used for this purpose.The storage container is connected via a DN 25 diameter fitting to an isolating valve adjacent to the container and then via a DN 25 diameter PE, PP or PB pipe to a threaded junction for the test fitting. The volume contained in the pipe between the isolating valve and the entry to the fitting shall be (350 \u00b110) mL.", "HIGH TEMPERATURE TESTS(Normative)J1 SCOPELicensed to Mr LIM YH on 4 December 2009. 1 user personal user licence only.

Such products, if found to be satisfactory by the other tests described in this Standard, can be tested by the method described in this Appendix if they are intended for use in hot water installations and the water in contact with the product will pass to a draw-off point from which the water is intended for drinking purposes.This Appendix describes the extraction procedure to be used in assessing the ability of a product to impart a discernible taste or any noticeable colour or turbidity to hot water intended for drinking. It is also applicable in assessing the leaching of metals from products in hot water and the extraction from such products of substances that may be of concern to public health. It is not applicable to the test for growth of aquatic micro-organisms (see Appendix E), except where the product is to be used for cold and hot water applications.

Storage, distribution or use on network prohibited (10074895).Components made from a single material may be pre-qualified by a simulated sample that has been tested and shown to meet the requirements of this Standard. The simulated sample is manufactured using the same manufacturing processes and having an envelope of characteristics (e.g. dimensions, surface finish, material composition) within which the components lie. For example, plastic pipe samples would not be represented by compression-moulded samples.M3 TYPICAL EXAMPLES OF SIMULATED SAMPLESThe process of pre-qualification may be applicable to the following types of materials:(a) Metals and metallic alloys.(b) Plastic materials.M4 SPECIAL ISSUESFor assessment purposes, it is critical that the documentation surrounding the simulated sample is comprehensive so that a clear relationship exists between the simulated sample and the component under consideration.A clear description of the simulated sample should include the following:(a) General description including a specific sample number.(b) Material designation, such as\u2014(i) manufacturer, commercial grade of material and reference to the relevant standard; and(ii) where the maximum level of a specific element(s) of the material is critical to the test requirements, a measurement and recording of these elements and their maximum level. The acceptable variation in concentration of specific elements/ingredients in the sample from that allowed in a supplied component should be specified in the product Standard. For example, if the composition of the simulated sample is 71.8%A, 25.0%B, 3.0%C and 0.2%D, the product Standard might accept compositions of: \u2264 75.4%A, \u2264 26.25%B, \u2264 3.15%C,\u2264 0.3%D (and no other ingredients) in a component. This example is based onthall of the ingredients of the component being not more than 1/20 of the valueor 0.1% (whichever is the higher) more than the amounts that were in the simulated sample.(c) The processing used to manufacture the simulated sample should be the same as that used to manufacture the components and should be defined as follows:", "TEST REPORT(Normative)N1 GENERALThe test report shall include the particulars shown in Paragraphs N2 and N3, plus the additional details shown in Paragraph N4 that are specific to the given test.N2 TEST REPORT INFORMATIONLicensed to Mr LIM YH on 4 December 2009. 1 user personal user licence only.
